We generated mice with global inducible post-natal inactivation or adipose-specific loss of the Enpp2 gene encoding ATX. The animals are phenotypically unremarkable and exhibit differences in adipocyte size and adipose tissue expression of inflammatory genes after high fat feeding without gross differences in fat distribution or body mass. Surprisingly, both models of Enpp2- deficiency exhibited marked protection from high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. This phenotype was not associated with differences in dietary fat absorption but may be accounted for by differences in hepatic expression of genes involved in de novo synthesis of triglycerides. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ATX might be protective against hepatic steatosis.",

      "abstract": "Environmental pollution contributes to fatty liver disease pathogenesis. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures have been associated with liver enzyme elevation and suspected steatohepatitis in cohort studies. Male mice treated with the commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260 (20 mg/kg), and fed high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks developed steatohepatitis. Receptor-based modes of action including inhibition of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor were previously proposed, but other mechanisms likely exist. Objectives were to identify and validate the pathways, transcription factors, and mechanisms responsible for the steatohepatitis associated with PCB and HFD coexposures. Comparative proteomics analysis was performed in archived mouse liver samples from the aforementioned chronic exposure study. Pathway and transcription factor analysis (TFA) was performed, and selected results were validated. Liver proteomics detected 1103 unique proteins. Aroclor 1260 upregulated 154 and downregulated 93 of these. Aroclor 1260 + HFD coexposures affected 55 pathways including glutathione metabolism, intermediary metabolism, and cytoskeletal remodeling. TFA of Aroclor 1260 treatment demonstrated alterations in the function of 42 transcription factors including downregulation of NRF2 and key nuclear receptors previously demonstrated to protect against steatohepatitis (e.g., HNF4\u03b1, FXR, PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3, etc.). Validation studies demonstrated that Aroclor 1260 significantly reduced HNF4\u03b1 protein levels, while Aroclor 1260 + HFD reduced expression of the HNF4\u03b1 target gene, albumin, in vivo. Aroclor 1260 attenuated EGF-dependent HNF4\u03b1 phosphorylation and target gene activation in vitro. Aroclor 1260 reduced levels of NRF2, its target genes, and glutathione in vivo. Aroclor 1260 attenuated EGF-dependent NRF2 upregulation, in vitro. Aroclor 1260 indirectly activated hepatic stellate cells in vitro via induction of hepatocyte-derived TGF\u03b2. PCB exposures adversely impacted transcription factors regulating liver protection, function, and fibrosis. PCBs, thus, compromised the liver by reducing its protective responses against nutritional stress to promote diet-induced steatohepatitis. The identified mechanisms by which environmental pollutants influence fatty liver disease pathogenesis require confirmation in humans.",

      "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of sepsis, produces pyocyanin, a blue-pigmented virulence factor. Sepsis is associated with cachexia, but mechanisms are unknown and conventional nutrition approaches are not effective treatments. Pyocyanin has affinity for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is expressed on adipocytes and regulates adipocyte differentiation. The purpose of this study was to define in vitro and in vivo effects of pyocyanin on adipocyte differentiation and body weight regulation as relates to septic cachexia. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, pyocyanin activated AhR and its downstream marker CYP1a1, and reduced differentiation. Administration of pyocyanin to male C57BL/6J mice acutely reduced body temperature with altered locomotion, but caused sustained weight loss. Chronic pyocyanin administration to male and female C57BL/6J mice resulted in sustained reductions in body weight and fat mass, with adipose-specific AhR activation. Pyocyanin-treated male mice had decreased energy expenditure and physical activity, and increased adipose explant lipolysis. In females, pyocyanin caused robust reductions in body weight, adipose-specific AhR activation, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in differentiated adipocytes. These results demonstrate that pyocyanin reduces adipocyte differentiation and decreases body weight and fat mass in male and female mice, suggesting that pyocyanin may play a role in septic cachexia.",

      "abstract": "The sphingolipid ceramide regulates beta-oxidation of medium and long chain fatty acids in mitochondria. It is not known whether it also regulates oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in peroxisomes. Using affinity chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays we discovered that ceramide interacts with Hsd17b4, an enzyme critical for peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) generation. Immunocytochemistry showed that Hsd17b4 is distributed to ceramide-enriched mitochondria-associated membranes (CEMAMs). Molecular docking and in vitro mutagenesis experiments showed that ceramide binds to the sterol carrier protein 2-like domain in Hsd17b4 adjacent to peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1), the C-terminal signal for interaction with peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (Pex5), a peroxin mediating transport of Hsd17b4 into peroxisomes. Inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis induced translocation of Hsd17b4 from CEMAMs to peroxisomes, interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5, and upregulation of DHA. This data indicates a novel role of ceramide as a molecular switch regulating interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5 and peroxisomal function.",

Biological sex is determined by sex hormones and chromosomes, but effects of sex chromosomes on circulating lipids and atherosclerosis are unknown. Here, we use mouse models to separate effects of sex chromosomes and hormones on atherosclerosis, circulating lipids and intestinal fat metabolism. We assess atherosclerosis in multiple models and experimental paradigms that distinguish effects of sex chromosomes, and male or female gonads. Pro-atherogenic lipids and atherosclerosis are greater in XX than XY mice, indicating a primary effect of sex chromosomes. Small intestine expression of enzymes involved in lipid absorption and chylomicron assembly are greater in XX male and female mice with higher intestinal lipids. Together, our results show that an XX sex chromosome complement promotes the bioavailability of dietary fat to accelerate atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) accumulate with obesity, but during weight loss, liberated PCBs act as ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to negatively influence health. Previous studies demonstrated that PCB-77 administration to obese male mice impaired glucose tolerance during weight loss. Recent studies indicate higher toxic equivalencies of dioxin-like PCBs in exposed females than males.\nWe compared effects of PCB-77 on weight gain or loss and glucose homeostasis in male vs. female mice. We defined effects of AhR deficiency during weight gain or loss in male and female mice exposed to PCB-77.\nStudy design was vehicle (VEH) or PCB-77 administration while fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 12 wk, followed by weight loss for 4 wk. The following groups were examined: male and female C57BL/6 mice administered VEH or PCB-77, female [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] mice administered VEH or PCB-77, and male [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] mice administered PCB-77. Glucose tolerance was quantified during weight gain (week 11) and loss (week 15); liver and adipose AhR and IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) mRNA abundance, and PCB-77 concentrations were quantified at week 16.\nPCB-77 attenuated development of obesity in females but not males. During weight loss, PCB-77 impaired glucose tolerance of males. AhR-deficient females (VEH) were resistant to diet-induced obesity. Compared with VEH-treated mice, HF-fed [Formula: see text] females treated with PCB-77 has less weight gain, and [Formula: see text] females had greater weight gain. During weight loss, [Formula: see text] females but not [Formula: see text] males treated with PCB-77 exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. In [Formula: see text] females administered PCB-77, IRS2 mRNA abundance was lower in adipose tissue compared with VEH-treated mice.\nMale and female mice responded differently to PCB-77 and AhR deficiency in body weight (BW) regulation and glucose homeostasis. AhR deficiency reversed PCB-77-induced glucose impairment of obese males losing weight but augmented glucose intolerance of females. These results demonstrate sex differences in PCB-77-induced regulation of glucose homeostasis of mice. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4133.",

      "abstract": "Studies on vesicle formation by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex have contributed to a basic understanding of how vesicular transport is initiated. Phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) have been found previously to be required for the fission stage of COPI vesicle formation. Here, we find that PA with varying lipid geometry can all promote early fission, but only PA with shortened acyl chains promotes late fission. Moreover, diacylglycerol (DAG) acts after PA in late fission, with this role of DAG also requiring shorter acyl chains. Further highlighting the importance of the short-chain lipid geometry for late fission, we find that shorter forms of PA and DAG promote the vesiculation ability of COPI fission factors. These findings advance a general understanding of how lipid geometry contributes to membrane deformation for vesicle fission, and also how proteins and lipids coordinate their actions in driving this process.",

      "abstract": "The increased incidence of non-communicable human diseases may be attributed, at least partially, to exposures to toxic chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), air pollutants and heavy metals. Given the high mortality and morbidity of pollutant exposure associated diseases, a better understanding of the related mechanisms of toxicity and impacts on the endogenous host metabolism are needed. The metabolome represents the collection of the intermediates and end products of cellular processes, and is the most proximal reporter of the body's response to environmental exposures and pathological processes. Metabolomics is a powerful tool for studying how organisms interact with their environment and how these interactions shape diseases related to pollutant exposure. This mini review discusses potential biological mechanisms that link pollutant exposure to metabolic disturbances and chronic human diseases, with a focus on recent studies that demonstrate the application of metabolomics as a tool to elucidate biochemical modes of actions of various environmental pollutants. In addition, classes of metabolites that have been shown to be modulated by multiple environmental pollutants will be discussed with an emphasis on their use as potential early biomarkers of disease risks. Taken together, metabolomics is a useful and versatile tool for characterizing the disease risks and mechanisms associated with various environmental pollutants.",

      "abstract": "The gut-microbe-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is increased by insulin resistance and associated with several sequelae of metabolic syndrome in humans, including cardiovascular, renal, and neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism by which TMAO promotes disease is unclear. We now reveal the endoplasmic reticulum stress kinase PERK (EIF2AK3) as a receptor for TMAO: TMAO binds to PERK at physiologically relevant concentrations; selectively activates the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response; and induces the transcription factor FoxO1, a key driver\u00a0of metabolic disease, in a PERK-dependent manner. Furthermore, interventions to reduce TMAO, either by manipulation of the gut microbiota or by inhibition of the TMAO synthesizing enzyme, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3, can reduce PERK activation and FoxO1 levels in the liver. Taken together, these data suggest TMAO and PERK may be central to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome.",

Although the mechanisms involved are likely complex, these associations suggest that lowering circulating Cer levels could be protective against cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, dietary fibers, such as inulin, have been reported to promote cardiovascular and metabolic health. However, the mechanisms involved in these protective processes also are not well understood. We studied the effects of inulin on lipid metabolism with a model of atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice using lipidomics and transcriptomics. Plasma and tissues were collected at 10 days and/or 12 weeks after feeding mice an atherogenic diet supplemented with inulin or cellulose (control). Compared with controls, inulin-fed mice displayed a decreased C16:0/C24:0 plasma Cer ratio and lower levels of circulating Cers associated with VLDL and LDL.

      "abstract": "Per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are a large group of synthetic surfactant chemicals with widespread uses in food packaging and textile manufacturing and as the main constituent of aqueous film-forming firefighting foams. PFASs are highly persistent in the environment, and human exposures are extensive with these chemicals detectable in the blood of almost all adult Americans. PFASs exhibit a range of toxic effects in preclinical models. In humans, PFAS exposure has been associated with lower birth weights, decreased immune responses, cancer and impaired fertility and elevated circulating cholesterol levels. We have developed a sensitive high-throughput method for quantification of representative PFAS in human serum and plasma for biomonitoring and epidemiological studies of human health effects of PFAS exposure. The method combines robust and reproducible 96-well plate format sample preparation with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was developed, validated and used for targeted measurements of eight short-/long-chain PFAS analytes in human serum. Targeted analytes were measured in 50 microliters of sample using mass-labeled internal standards. Mean spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a010) of target analytes for three tiers quality control (QC-low, QC-medium, QC-high) samples ranged from 70 to 127% with 2-14% relative standard deviation (RSD). The average spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a010) of surrogates were 79-115% with 8-12% RSD for QC-low, 90-123% with 7-12% RSD for QC-medium and 82-114% with 9-15% RSD for QC-high. The limit of detection for the target compounds was 0.05-0.04\u00a0ng/mL. The method was used to reveal regional differences in PFAS exposures in Kentucky residents receiving care at the University of Kentucky Hospitals.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBeige adipose tissue is associated with improved glucose homeostasis in mice. Adipose tissue contains \u03b23-adrenergic receptors (\u03b23-ARs), and this study was intended to determine whether the treatment of obese, insulin-resistant humans with the \u03b23-AR agonist mirabegron, which stimulates beige adipose formation in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC WAT), would induce other beneficial changes in fat and muscle and improve metabolic homeostasis.METHODSBefore and after \u03b23-AR agonist treatment, oral glucose tolerance tests and euglycemic clamps were performed, and histochemical analysis and gene expression profiling were performed on fat and muscle biopsies. PET-CT scans quantified brown adipose tissue volume and activity, and we conducted in vitro studies with primary cultures of differentiated human adipocytes and muscle.RESULTSThe clinical effects of mirabegron treatment included improved oral glucose tolerance (P < 0.01), reduced hemoglobin A1c levels (P = 0.01), and improved insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03) and \u03b2 cell function (P = 0.01). In SC WAT, mirabegron treatment stimulated lipolysis, reduced fibrotic gene expression, and increased alternatively activated macrophages. Subjects with the most SC WAT beiging showed the greatest improvement in \u03b2 cell function. In skeletal muscle, mirabegron reduced triglycerides, increased the expression of PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1 \u03b1 (PGC1A) (P < 0.05), and increased type I fibers (P < 0.01). Conditioned media from adipocytes treated with mirabegron stimulated muscle fiber PGC1A expression in vitro (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONMirabegron treatment substantially improved multiple measures of glucose homeostasis in obese, insulin-resistant humans. Since \u03b2 cells and skeletal muscle do not express \u03b23-ARs, these data suggest that the beiging of SC WAT by mirabegron reduces adipose tissue dysfunction, which enhances muscle oxidative capacity and improves \u03b2 cell function.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicaltrials.gov NCT02919176.FUNDINGNIH: DK112282, P30GM127211, DK 71349, and Clinical and Translational science Awards (CTSA) grant UL1TR001998.",

      "abstract": "Phospholipases D (PLDs) catalyze hydrolysis of the diester bond of phospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid and the free lipid headgroup. In mammals, PLD enzymes comprise the intracellular enzymes PLD1 and PLD2 and possibly the proteins encoded by related genes, as well as a class of cell surface and secreted enzymes with structural homology to ectonucleotide phosphatases/phosphodiesterases as typified by autotaxin (ENPP2) that have lysoPLD activities. Genetic and pharmacological loss-of-function approaches implicate these enzymes in intra- and intercellular signaling mediated by the lipid products phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, and their metabolites, while the possibility that the water-soluble product of their reactions is biologically relevant has received far less attention. PLD1 and PLD2 are highly selective for phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas autotaxin has broader substrate specificity for lysophospholipids but by virtue of the high abundance of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in extracellular fluids predominantly hydrolyses this substrate. In all cases, the water-soluble product of these PLD activities is choline. Although choline can be formed de novo by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, this activity is absent in most tissues, so mammals are effectively auxotrophic for choline. Dietary consumption of choline in both free and esterified forms is substantial. Choline is necessary for synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and of the choline-containing phospholipids PC and sphingomyelin (SM) and also plays a recently appreciated important role as a methyl donor in the pathways of \"one-carbon (1C)\" metabolism. This review discusses emerging evidence that some of the biological functions of these intra- and extracellular PLD enzymes involve generation of choline with a particular focus on the possibility that these choline and PLD dependent processes are dysregulated in cancer.",

      "abstract": "The bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation in cardiovascular diseases. Produced in large part by the secreted lysophospholipase D autotaxin (ATX), LPA acts on a series of G protein-coupled receptors and may have action on atypical receptors such as RAGE to exert potent effects on vascular cells, including the promotion of foam cell formation and phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. The signaling effects of LPA can be terminated by integral membrane lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) that hydrolyze the lipid to receptor inactive products. Human genetic variants in PLPP3, that predict lower levels of LPP3, associate with risk for premature coronary artery disease, and reductions of LPP3 expression in mice promote the development of experimental atherosclerosis and enhance inflammation in the atherosclerotic lesions. Recent evidence also supports a role for ATX, and potentially LPP3, in calcific aortic stenosis. In summary, LPA may be a relevant inflammatory mediator in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heightened LPA signaling may explain the cardiovascular disease risk effect of PLPP3 variants.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of polyamine metabolism has been linked to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying mechanism is incompletely characterized. Here, we report that spermine synthase (SMS), a polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, is overexpressed in CRC. Targeted disruption of SMS in CRC cells results in spermidine accumulation, which inhibits FOXO3a acetylation and allows subsequent translocation to the nucleus to transcriptionally induce expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim. However, this induction is blunted by MYC-driven expression of miR-19a and miR-19b that repress Bim production. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MYC activity in SMS-depleted CRC cells dramatically induces Bim expression and apoptosis and causes tumor regression, but these effects are profoundly attenuated by silencing Bim. These findings uncover a key survival signal in CRC through convergent repression of Bim expression by distinct SMS- and MYC-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, combined inhibition of SMS and MYC signaling may be an effective therapy for CRC.",

Exposure to these chemicals is ubiquitous, and can lead to potential synergistic adverse effects in individuals exposed to both classes of chemicals. The present study was designed to identify interactions between PCB126 and PFOS that might promote acute changes in inflammatory pathways associated with cardiovascular disease and liver injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to vehicle, PCB126, PFOS, or a mixture of both pollutants. Plasma and liver samples were collected at 48\u00a0h after exposure. Changes in the expression of hepatic genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerosis were investigated. Plasma and liver samples was analyzed using untargeted lipidomic method. Hepatic mRNA levels for Nqo1, Icam1, and PAI1 were significantly increased in the mixture-exposed mice. Plasma levels of PAI1, a marker of fibrosis and thrombosis, were also significantly elevated in the mixture-exposed group. Liver injury was observed only in the mixture-exposed mice. Lipidomic analysis revealed that co-exposure to the mixture enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation and elevated oxidized phospholipids levels. In summary, this study shows that acute co-exposure to PCB126 and PFOS in mice results in liver injury and increased cardiovascular disease risk.",

      "abstract": "Platelet transfusion is a life-saving therapy to prevent or treat bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. However, for >6 decades, safe and effective strategies for platelet storage have been an impediment to widespread use of platelet transfusion. Refrigerated platelets are cleared rapidly from circulation, precluding cold storage of platelets for transfusion. Consequently, platelets are stored at room temperature with an upper limit of 5 days due to risks of bacterial contamination and loss of platelet function. This practice severely limits platelet availability for transfusion. This study is to identify the mechanism of platelet clearance after cold storage and develop a method for platelet cold storage. Approach and Results: We found that rapid clearance of cold-stored platelets was largely due to integrin activation and apoptosis. Deficiency of integrin \u03b23 or caspase-3 prolonged cold-stored platelets in circulation. Pretreatment of platelets with EGTA, a cell impermeable calcium ion chelator, reversely inhibited cold storage-induced platelet activation and consequently prolonged circulation of cold-stored platelets. Moreover, transfusion of EGTA-treated, cold-stored platelets, but not room temperature-stored platelets, into the mice deficient in glycoprotein Ib\u03b1 significantly shortened tail-bleeding times and diminished blood loss.\nIntegrin activation and apoptosis is the underlying mechanism of rapid clearance of platelets after cold storage. Addition of a cell impermeable calcium ion chelator to platelet products is potentially a simple and effective method to enable cold storage of platelets for transfusion.",

      "abstract": "Nanomaterials with tunable properties show promise because of their size-dependent electronic structure and controllable physical properties. The purpose of this research was to develop and validate environmentally safe nanomaterial-based approach for treatment of drinking water including removal and degradation of per- and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFAS). PFAS are surfactant chemicals with broad uses that are now recognized as contaminants with a significant risk to human health. They are commonly used in household and industrial products. They are extremely persistent in the environment because they possess both hydrophobic fluorine-saturated carbon chains and hydrophilic functional groups, along with being oleophobic. Traditional drinking water treatment technologies are usually ineffective for the removal of PFAS from contaminated waters, because they are normally present in exiguous concentrations and have unique properties that make them persistent. Therefore, there is a critical need for safe and efficient remediation methods for PFAS, particularly in drinking water. The proposed novel approach has also a potential application for decreasing PFAS background levels in analytical systems. In this study, nanocomposite membranes composed of sulfonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) and two-dimensional phosphorene were fabricated, and they obtained on average 99% rejection of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) alongside with a 99% removal from the PFOA that accumulated on surface of the membrane. The removal of PFOA accumulated on the membrane surface achieved 99% after the membranes were treated with ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and liquid aerobic oxidation.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to blast overpressure waves is implicated as the major cause of ocular injuries and resultant visual dysfunction in veterans involved in recent combat operations. No effective therapeutic strategies have been developed so far for blast-induced ocular dysfunction. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid generated by activated platelets, astrocytes, choroidal plexus cells, and microglia and is reported to play major roles in stimulating inflammatory processes. The levels of LPA in the cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to increase acutely in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model in mice. In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous administration of a monoclonal LPA antibody (25 mg/kg) given at 1 h post-blast for protection against injuries to the retina and associated ocular dysfunctions. Our results show that a single 19 psi blast exposure significantly increased the levels of several species of LPA in blood plasma at 1 and 4 h post-blast. The anti-LPA antibody treatment significantly decreased glial cell activation and preserved neuronal cell morphology in the retina on day 8 after blast exposure. Optokinetic measurements indicated that anti-LPA antibody treatment significantly improved visual acuity in both eyes on days 2 and 6 post-blast exposure. Anti-LPA antibody treatment significantly increased rod photoreceptor and bipolar neuronal cell signaling in both eyes on day 7 post-blast exposure. These results suggest that blast exposure triggers release of LPAs, which play a major role promoting blast-induced ocular injuries, and that a single early administration of anti-LPA antibodies provides significant protection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBeige and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are associated with improved metabolic homeostasis. We recently reported that the \u03b23-adrenergic receptor agonist mirabegron induced beige adipose tissue in obese insulin-resistant subjects, and this was accompanied by improved glucose metabolism. Here we evaluated pioglitazone treatment with a combination pioglitazone and mirabegron treatment and compared these with previously published data evaluating mirabegron treatment alone. Both drugs were used at FDA-approved dosages.METHODSWe measured BAT by PET CT scans, measured beige adipose tissue by immunohistochemistry, and comprehensively characterized glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by euglycemic clamp and oral glucose tolerance tests. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue, muscle fiber type composition and capillary density, lipotoxicity, and systemic inflammation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling, mass spectroscopy, and ELISAs.RESULTSTreatment with pioglitazone or the combination of pioglitazone and mirabegron increased beige adipose tissue protein marker expression and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, but neither treatment induced BAT in these obese subjects. When the magnitude of the responses to the treatments was evaluated, mirabegron was found to be the most effective at inducing beige adipose tissue. Although monotherapy with either mirabegron or pioglitazone induced adipose beiging, combination treatment resulted in less beiging than either alone. The 3 treatments also had different effects on muscle fiber type switching and capillary density.CONCLUSIONThe addition of pioglitazone to mirabegron treatment does not enhance beiging or increase BAT in obese insulin-resistant research participants.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02919176.FUNDINGNIH DK112282 and P20GM103527 and Clinical and Translational Science Awards grant UL1TR001998.",

      "abstract": "In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for ",

      "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with gene regulation and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function. Decreased eGFR is more common among US Hispanics and African Americans. The causes for this are poorly understood. We aimed to identify trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with eGFR using an agnostic, genome-wide approach.\nThe study included up to 5428 participants from multi-ethnic studies for discovery and 8109 participants for replication. We tested the associations between whole blood DNAm and eGFR using beta values from Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. Ethnicity-stratified analyses were performed using linear mixed models adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and study-specific and technical variables. Summary results were meta-analyzed within and across ethnicities. Findings were assessed using integrative epigenomics methods and pathway analyses.\nWe identified 93 DMPs associated with eGFR at an FDR of 0.05 and replicated 13 and 1 DMPs across independent samples in trans-ethnic and African American meta-analyses, respectively. The study also validated 6 previously published DMPs. Identified DMPs showed significant overlap enrichment with DNase I hypersensitive sites in kidney tissue, sites associated with the expression of proximal genes, and transcription factor motifs and pathways associated with kidney tissue and kidney development.\nWe uncovered trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific DMPs associated with eGFR, including DMPs enriched in regulatory elements in kidney tissue and pathways related to kidney development. These findings shed light on epigenetic mechanisms associated with kidney function, bridging the gap between population-specific eGFR-associated DNAm and tissue-specific regulatory context.",

      "abstract": "Gabapentin is commonly prescribed for chronic pain, including to patients with HIV (PWH). There is growing concern regarding gabapentin's potential for harm, particularly in combination with opioids. Among PWH, we examined factors associated with higher doses of gabapentin receipt and determined if receipt varied by opioid use. We examined data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, a national prospective cohort including PWH, from 2002 through 2017. Covariates included prescribed opioid dose, self-reported past year opioid use, and other sociodemographic and clinical variables. We used multinomial logistic regression to determine independent predictors of gabapentin receipt. Among 3,702 PWH, 902 (24%) received any gabapentin during the study period at a mean daily dose of 1,469 mg. In the multinomial model, high-dose gabapentin receipt was associated with high-dose benzodiazepine receipt (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.53, [1.03-2.27]), pain interference (1.65 [1.39-1.95]), and hand or foot pain (1.81, [1.45-2.26]). High-dose gabapentin receipt was associated with prescribed high-dose opioids receipt (2.66 [1.95-3.62]) but not self-reported opioid use (1.03 [0.89-1.21]). PWH prescribed gabapentin at higher doses are more likely to receive high-dose opioids and high-dose benzodiazepines, raising safety concerns.",

There are no pharmacological treatments for this syndrome, but studies suggest that diaphragm weakness is linked to mitochondrial free radical generation. We hypothesized that administration of mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ), a mitochondrially targeted free radical scavenger, would prevent sepsis-induced diaphragm dysfunction. We compared diaphragm function in 4 groups of male mice: ",

      "abstract": "We developed and validated a method for direct determination of per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) in environmental water samples without prior sample concentration. Samples are centrifuged and supernatants passed through an Acrodisc Filter (GXF/GHP 0.2\u00a0\u00a0um, 25\u00a0\u00a0mm diameter). After addition of ammonium acetate, samples are analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS using an AB Sciex 6500 plus Q-Trap mass spectrometer operated in negative multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The instrument system incorporates a delay column between the pumps and autosampler to mitigate interference from background PFAS. The method monitors eight short-/long-chain PFAS which are identified by monitoring specific precursor product ion pairs and by their retention times and quantified using isotope mass-labeled internal standard based calibration plots. Average spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a08) of target analytes ranged from 84 to 110% with 4-9% relative standard deviation (RSD). The mean spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a08) of four surrogates were 94-106% with 3-8% RSD. For continuous calibration verification (CCV), average spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a08) for target analytes ranged from 88 to 114% with 4-11% RSD and for surrogates ranged from 104-112% with 3-11% RSD. The recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a06) of matrix spike (MX), matrix spike duplicate (MXD), and field reagent blank (FRB) met our acceptance criteria. The limit of detection for the target analytes was between 0.007 and 0.04\u00a0ng/mL. The method was used to measure PFAS in tap water and surface water.",
