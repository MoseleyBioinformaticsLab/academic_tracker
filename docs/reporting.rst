Reporting
=========

To allow users some flexibility in report creation a unique system for specifying 
how to build reports was created. This system is described here. The key framework 
to keep in mind is that there are 3 different reports and 2 ways to build each one. 
The specifications also slightly differ between each other and between author_search 
and reference_search. The 3 reports are summary_report, project_report, and collaborator_report. 
Each report can be specified using a formatted text string or using a dictionary 
to specify rows and columns.

To specify a report using a formatted string include the "template" attribute for 
the report. To specify a report using rows and columns include the "columns" 
attribute for the report. "columns" should be a dictionary where the keys are 
column names and values are what should be in each row of the column. Typically, 
the values will be keywords. 

If specifying the report with the "columns" attribute there are other attributes 
that can be used in conjuction. "file_format" allows you to specify whether the 
report should be a CSV or Excel file. The 2 allowed values are "csv" and "xlsx". 
"sort" allows you to specify how to sort the table. It should be a list of column 
names. Similarly, "column_order" allows you to specify the order of the columns 
of the table. The order of the columns should be the same as the order given in 
"columns", but just in case "column_order" is provided to manually set the order. 
"separator" allows you to specify the separator character for CSV files. It must 
be one character in length and defaults to a comma. 

"filename" allows you to specify the filename of the report regardless of whether 
"columns" or "template" are used to specify the report, but if the "file_format" 
is "xlsx" and the filename extension is not xlsx then ".xlsx" will be added to 
the filename.

To email a report as an attachment simply include the email related attributes 
in the report section. If the email attributes are missing then no email is sent.


Example Config JSON Excerpt
---------------------------
.. code-block:: console
    
    "summary_report" : {"template":"This is a header\n<project_loop><project_name>:\n<author_loop><author_first>:\n<pub_loop><title></pub_loop></author_loop></project_loop>",
                        
                        "columns":{"Project":"<project_name>", "Author":"<author_first>; <author_last>", "Publication":"<title>"},
                        "column_order":["Project", "Author", "Publication"],
                        "sort":["Project", "Author"],
                        "file_format":"csv",
                        "separator":"\t",
                        
                        "filename":"summary_report.txt",
                        
                        "email_body":"Please see attached summary_report.",
                        "email_subject":"Summary of Publications",
                        "to_email":["person1@email.edu"],
                        "from_email":"your_email@email.edu",
                        "cc_email":["person2@email.edu"]}
                        
    Note that "template" takes precedent over "columns" so if both are specified "template" is used. This example is just trying to give a full example.




Summary Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the summary_report section of the configuration JSON a custom summary report 
can be created. Academic Tracker will read the template or columns attribute of 
this section and certain keywords (described below) will be replaced with information 
collected during the run. The keywords and inherent nature of how the report is 
built differs between author_search and reference_search.

If the summary_report section is missing then no summary report will be made. 
If the template and columns attributes are not in the summary_report section then 
a default template will be used (described below). 

Summary reports are saved in the tracker directory under summary_report.txt by default.


Author Search
-------------
The report for the author_search is built by looping over each project, each 
author associated with the project, each publication associated with the author, 
and each author on the publication. The template for author_search has 4 sections, 
1 for each loop (project_loop, author_loop, pub_loop, and pub_author_loop). Tags 
denote the beginning and end of each loop.
 
The section determines when keywords in the template are replaced. Keywords inside
the pub_author_loop section are replaced for each author on the publication. 
Keywords inside the pub_loop section are replaced for each publication associated 
with the author. Keywords inside the author_loop are replaced for each author 
associated with the project. Keywords inside the project loop section are replaced 
for each project. The sections are expected to be nested inside of each other, 
so the pub_author_loop tags should be inside the pub_loop tags, the pub_loop tags 
should be inside the author_loop tags, and the author_loop tags should be inside 
the project_loop tags. If they are not then the report will most likely not look 
as expected.


Reference Search
----------------
The report for the reference_search is built by looping over each publication matched 
in the reference, and each author on the publication. The template has 2 sections, 
1 for each loop (pub_loop and pub_author_loop). Tags denote the beginning and end 
of each loop. The section determines when keywords in the template are replaced. 
Keywords inside the pub_author_loop section are replaced for each author on the 
publication. Keywords inside the pub_loop section are replaced for each publication. 
The sections are expected to be nested inside of each other, so the pub_author_loop 
tags should be inside the pub_loop tags. If they are not then the report will 
most likely not look as expected.


Project Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Project reports are only created for author_search. There is no conception of them 
in reference_search. To create project reports for a project include the project_report 
attribute for the project in the config JSON. The project report works similar 
to the summary report but is isolated to one project so lacks the project loop. 

If the project_report attribute is missing then no project report will be made. 
If the template and columns attributes are not in the project_report section then 
a default template will be used (described below). If from_email is absent then 
1 report that loops over each author and publication in the project will be 
generated and no emails sent. If from_email is provided and to_email is provided 
then the report is emailed. If to_email is not provided then a report is generated 
for each author individually and emailed to each author.

Project reports are saved in the tracker directory under 
projectname_project_report.txt or projectname_authorname_project_report.txt by 
default.

Collaborator Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a collaborator report for an author is actually a unique use case from 
a typical author_search run, but since all of the steps are the same it is included 
as a report in author_search rather than being its own command. The idea is to 
be able to go through an author's publications and build a report that contains 
all of the other authors they have worked with. This type of report is required 
by some funding providers.

Collaborator reports are only created for author_search. There is no conception 
of them in reference_search. To create a collaborator report for an author include 
the collaborator_report attribute for the author in the config JSON. Although a 
collaborator report is done on a per author basis it can be included in a project 
of the config JSON as a convenience. If it is included in a project then a collaborator 
report will be created for each author associated with the project. 

The report is built by looping over each publication for the author and each 
author on the publication. Unlike the project report though only the pub_author_loop 
is available for the collaborator report. Tags denote the beginning and end of 
the loop.

The collaborator report is a little unique compared to the sumary and project 
reports because it defaults to a tabular file using the "columns" attribute rather 
than using the "template" attribute. 

If the collaborator_report attribute is missing then no collaborator report will 
be made. If the template and columns attributes are not in the collaborator_report 
section then a default columns and sort will be used (described below). If from_email 
is absent then no emails will be sent. If from_email is provided and to_email is 
provided then the report is sent to the to_email address, otherwise it is sent 
to the author's email.

Collaborator reports are saved in the tracker directory under 
author_id_collaborators.csv by default.
