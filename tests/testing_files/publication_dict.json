    "abstract": "Humans are constantly exposed to exogenous chemicals throughout their life, which can lead to a multitude of negative health impacts. Advanced materials can play a key role in preventing or mitigating these impacts through a wide variety of applications. The tunable properties of hydrogels and hydrogel nanocomposites (e.g., swelling behavior, biocompatibility, stimuli responsiveness, functionality, etc.) have deemed them ideal platforms for removal of environmental contaminants, detoxification and reduction of body burden from exogenous chemical exposures for prevention of disease initiation, and advanced treatment of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In this review, three main junctures where the use of hydrogel and hydrogel nanocomposite materials can intervene to positively impact human health are highlighted: (1) preventing exposures to environmental contaminants; (2) prophylactic treatments to prevent chronic disease initiation; (3) treating chronic diseases after they have developed.

    "abstract": "Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is one of the major precision medicine treatment options for lung adenocarcinoma. Due to common development of drug resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs, third-generation inhibitors, including osimertinib and rociletinib, have been developed. A model of EGFR-driven lung cancer and a method to develop tumors of distinct epigenetic states through 3D organotypic cultures are described here. It is discovered that activation of the EGFR T790M/L858R mutation in lung epithelial cells can drive lung cancers with alveolar or bronchiolar features, which can originate from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells or bronchioalveolar stem cells, but not basal cells or club cells of the trachea. It is also demonstrated that these clones are able to retain their epigenetic differences through passaging orthotopically in mice and crucially that they have distinct drug vulnerabilities. This work serves as a blueprint for exploring how epigenetics can be used to stratify patients for precision medicine decisions.",

    "abstract": "Phospholipases D (PLDs) catalyze hydrolysis of the diester bond of phospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid and the free lipid headgroup. In mammals, PLD enzymes comprise the intracellular enzymes PLD1 and PLD2 and possibly the proteins encoded by related genes, as well as a class of cell surface and secreted enzymes with structural homology to ectonucleotide phosphatases/phosphodiesterases as typified by autotaxin (ENPP2) that have lysoPLD activities. Genetic and pharmacological loss-of-function approaches implicate these enzymes in intra- and intercellular signaling mediated by the lipid products phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, and their metabolites, while the possibility that the water-soluble product of their reactions is biologically relevant has received far less attention. PLD1 and PLD2 are highly selective for phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas autotaxin has broader substrate specificity for lysophospholipids but by virtue of the high abundance of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in extracellular fluids predominantly hydrolyses this substrate. In all cases, the water-soluble product of these PLD activities is choline. Although choline can be formed de novo by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, this activity is absent in most tissues, so mammals are effectively auxotrophic for choline. Dietary consumption of choline in both free and esterified forms is substantial. Choline is necessary for synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and of the choline-containing phospholipids PC and sphingomyelin (SM) and also plays a recently appreciated important role as a methyl donor in the pathways of \"one-carbon (1C)\" metabolism. This review discusses emerging evidence that some of the biological functions of these intra- and extracellular PLD enzymes involve generation of choline with a particular focus on the possibility that these choline and PLD dependent processes are dysregulated in cancer.",

    "abstract": "To investigate sex differences in associations between sexual violence victimization (SVV), sexual violence perpetration (SVP), and binge drinking and/or alcohol problems among high school students. While SVV has been linked to problem alcohol use among young women, little research has addressed the unique associations of SVV and SVP on alcohol use/problems within both sexes. A cross-sectional analysis of 16,992 high school students' self-reports of past-year SVP and SVV was used where SVV/SVP was defined by three tactics (sexual coercion, drug/alcohol-facilitated or incapacitated sex, and physically forced sex). Alcohol measures included past-month binge drinking and past-year alcohol problems. Rates of SVV were twice as high in females (21.2% vs. 13.3%), and SVP rates were twice as high in males (10.9% vs. 5.2%). SVV and SVP were each associated with an increased rate of current binge drinking and problem alcohol use for both sexes, across increasing numbers of SV tactics and within each of three tactics. After controlling for demographic and other risk factors including SVP, drug/alcohol-facilitated or incapacitated SVV was more strongly linked to binge drinking and alcohol problems among females. SVP was more strongly linked to binge drinking and alcohol problems among males (adjusting for SVV and other covariates). No sex differences emerged in associations between coerced or physically forced SVV/SVP and alcohol-related outcomes. Both SVV and SVP are associated with an increased likelihood of binge drinking and alcohol problems for males and females. Important sex differences emerged when SV tactics are considered.",

    "abstract": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided funding (U01\u00a0CE002668) to evaluate bystander program efficacy to reduce gender-based violence on college campuses (Aim 1) and to create a mentoring network (Aim 2) for young campus-based researchers interested in violence intervention or prevention (VIP). While an evaluation of this mentoring program is ongoing, our purpose here was to document the strategies used to create, implement, and begin evaluation of this national multi-college mentoring network. As each public college was recruited into this evaluation named multi-college Bystander Efficacy Evaluation (mcBEE), each college was invited to nominate a researcher interested in receiving mentorship as a mcBEE fellow. Senior faculty with active VIP research careers were recruited as mentors. Mentorship occurred through annual meetings over time (2015-2019), weekly to bimonthly calls or video conferencing with 2-3 other fellows, and a mentor forming a group with 3-4 mentees, termed a hive. The initial focus of hive meetings was 1) creating and maintaining an active daily writing practice and 2) developing productivity plans, to include research, personal, and professional goals. Manuscript and grant writing feedback was provided throughout the network electronically or 'live' workshops. Annual surveys were implemented to investigate program efficacy. Our mcBEE team was able to successfully assemble a national network of VIP fellows and provide small group and individualized mentoring. Our ultimate goal was that of supporting our fellows' own trajectories in gender-based VIP research, teaching, administration, or service. Evaluation of our fellow and mentor cohort is ongoing (2015-2019).",

    "abstract": "In the US, approximately 8% of pregnant women smoke, and 5-11.9% currently use ENDS products. The health effects of ENDS use are debated; however, most contain nicotine which is known to cause adverse perinatal outcomes. Studies have shown adult ENDS users significantly alter use behaviors over time (switch to conventional cigarettes-only or dual use) thus complicating efforts to examine health effects of ENDS use. The purpose of this study was to describe switching behaviors and associated birth outcomes among infants of women using conventional cigarettes only, ENDS-only, or both.\nThis was a multisite, longitudinal study of biologically confirmed perinatal tobacco users, with nicotine product use assessed each trimester. For the purpose of analysis, participants were defined as switchers, no-switchers, or quitters. Birth outcomes were abstracted from electronic medical records. Analysis included descriptive statistics, linear and multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, preterm birth, smoking behavior in the first trimester, and an interaction between smoking switching behavior and smoking behavior in the first trimester. Analysis was conducted using SAS v9.4 with significance determined as p\u2009<\u20090.05.\nAt enrollment, 48.6% of participants used only conventional cigarettes, 41.7% were dual users, and 10% used ENDS-only. While almost two-thirds of participants used the same tobacco product throughout pregnancy, 26% reported switching behaviors that were complex and not easily clustered. No differences were found in birth outcomes between switchers and no-switchers; however, a difference emerged in birth weight between no-switchers and quitters.\nGiven the limited data on health effects of ENDS use, and the known harmful consequences of perinatal nicotine use, capturing and classifying product switching behaviors is imperative to inform public health, and remains a challenge requiring further research.",

    "abstract": "Bystander interventions have been highlighted as promising strategies to reduce sexual violence and sexual harassment, yet their effectiveness for sexual minority youth remains largely unexamined in high schools' populations. This rigorous cluster randomized control trial addresses this gap by evaluating intervention effectiveness among sexual majority and minority students known be to at increased risk of sexual violence. Kentucky high schools were randomized to intervention or control conditions. In intervention schools, educators provided school-wide Green Dot presentations (phase 1) and intensive bystander training to student popular opinion leaders (phase 2). Each spring from 2010 to 2014, students attending 26 high schools completed anonymous surveys about violence acceptance and violent events. An analytic sample of 74,836 surveys with no missing data over the 5\u00a0years was available. Sexual violence acceptance scores declined significantly over time in intervention versus control schools among all but sexual minority males. This intervention was also associated with reductions in both perpetration and victimization of sexual violence, sexual harassment, and physical dating violence among sexual majority yet not sexual minority youth. Both sexual minority and majority youth experienced reductions in stalking victimization and perpetration associated with the intervention. In this large cluster randomized controlled trial, the bystander intervention appears to work best to reduce violence for sexual majority youth. Bystander programs may benefit from explicitly engaging sexual minority youth in intervention efforts or adapting intervention programs to include attitudes that shape the experience of sexual minority high school youth (e.g., homophobic teasing, homonegativity).",

AKR/J mice, a model described to be susceptible to leukemia development, was used where females were maintained on either standard diet (SD), high sucrose diet, Western diet, or calorie restriction (CR) as they were mated with SD-fed males. Body weights, pregnancy rates, litter size, and litter survival were used as markers of successful pregnancy and pup health. Data indicated that maternal diet had significant effects on litter size, early pup survival, and early pup body weights. As pups matured, the makeup of their respective maternal diet was a predictor of adult metabolic health and survival. Overall, these results suggest that perinatal maternal diet is an important determinant of the health and survival of the offspring and that these effects continue well into adulthood, strongly correlating with lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL, aka. juvenile Batten disease or CLN3 disease) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by progressive blindness, seizures, cognitive and motor failures, and premature death. JNCL is caused by mutations in the Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal 3 (CLN3) gene, whose function is unclear. Although traditionally considered a neurodegenerative disease, CLN3 disease displays eye-specific effects: Vision loss not only is often one of the earliest symptoms of JNCL, but also has been reported in non-syndromic CLN3 disease. Here we described the roles of CLN3 protein in maintaining healthy retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and normal vision. Using electroretinogram, fundoscopy and microscopy, we showed impaired visual function, retinal autofluorescent lesions, and RPE disintegration and metaplasia/hyperplasia in a Cln3\u00a0~\u00a01\u00a0kb-deletion mouse model [1] on C57BL/6J background. Utilizing a combination of biochemical analyses, RNA-Seq, Seahorse XF bioenergetic analysis, and Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM), we further demonstrated that loss of CLN3 increased autophagic flux, suppressed mTORC1 and Akt activities, enhanced AMPK activity, and up-regulated gene expression of the autophagy-lysosomal system in RPE-1 cells, suggesting autophagy induction. This CLN3 deficiency induced autophagy induction coincided with decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and ATP production. We also reported for the first time that loss of CLN3 led to glycogen accumulation despite of impaired glycogen synthesis. Our comprehensive analyses shed light on how loss of CLN3 affect autophagy and metabolism. This work suggests possible links among metabolic impairment, autophagy induction and lysosomal storage, as well as between RPE atrophy/degeneration and vision loss in JNCL.",

    "abstract": "The bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation in cardiovascular diseases. Produced in large part by the secreted lysophospholipase D autotaxin (ATX), LPA acts on a series of G protein-coupled receptors and may have action on atypical receptors such as RAGE to exert potent effects on vascular cells, including the promotion of foam cell formation and phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. The signaling effects of LPA can be terminated by integral membrane lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) that hydrolyze the lipid to receptor inactive products. Human genetic variants in PLPP3, that predict lower levels of LPP3, associate with risk for premature coronary artery disease, and reductions of LPP3 expression in mice promote the development of experimental atherosclerosis and enhance inflammation in the atherosclerotic lesions. Recent evidence also supports a role for ATX, and potentially LPP3, in calcific aortic stenosis. In summary, LPA may be a relevant inflammatory mediator in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heightened LPA signaling may explain the cardiovascular disease risk effect of PLPP3 variants.",

    "abstract": "We developed and validated a method for direct determination of per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) in environmental water samples without prior sample concentration. Samples are centrifuged and supernatants passed through an Acrodisc Filter (GXF/GHP 0.2\u00a0\u00a0um, 25\u00a0\u00a0mm diameter). After addition of ammonium acetate, samples are analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS using an AB Sciex 6500 plus Q-Trap mass spectrometer operated in negative multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The instrument system incorporates a delay column between the pumps and autosampler to mitigate interference from background PFAS. The method monitors eight short-/long-chain PFAS which are identified by monitoring specific precursor product ion pairs and by their retention times and quantified using isotope mass-labeled internal standard based calibration plots. Average spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a08) of target analytes ranged from 84 to 110% with 4-9% relative standard deviation (RSD). The mean spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a08) of four surrogates were 94-106% with 3-8% RSD. For continuous calibration verification (CCV), average spiked recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a08) for target analytes ranged from 88 to 114% with 4-11% RSD and for surrogates ranged from 104-112% with 3-11% RSD. The recoveries (n\u00a0=\u00a06) of matrix spike (MX), matrix spike duplicate (MXD), and field reagent blank (FRB) met our acceptance criteria. The limit of detection for the target analytes was between 0.007 and 0.04\u00a0ng/mL. The method was used to measure PFAS in tap water and surface water.",

    "abstract": "Cluster randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) are popular in school-based research designs where schools are randomized to different trial arms. To help guide future study planning, we provide information on anticipated effect sizes and intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs), as well as school sizes, for dating violence (DV) and interpersonal violence outcomes based on data from a cRCT which evaluated the bystander-based violence intervention \nWe utilized data from 25 schools from the Green Dot High School study. Effect size and ICC values corresponding to dating and interpersonal violence outcomes are obtained from linear mixed effect models. We also calculated the required number of schools needed for future studies utilizing available methods that do and do not consider variation in school size.\nObserved effect sizes for DV outcomes range from 0.06 to 0.11. Observed ICC values for DV outcomes range from 0.0006 to 0.0032. The upper limit of 95% CIs for the true ICCs range from 0.0023 to 0.0070.\nSchool-based evaluations with violence outcomes are expected to have small effect sizes. Observed ICCs are less than 0.005 and upper limit of of 95% CIs for the true ICCs are less than 0.01. Designing school-based cRCTs should account for the ICC, even if its value is assumed to be negligible. Furthermore, variation in school sizes should also be accounted for to avoid having too few schools to achieve the desired power.",

This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020.\nWe evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020.\nKentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period.\nThis Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.",

    "abstract": "Residents of Anniston Alabama were highly exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) due to longstanding manufacturing in the area. The Anniston Community Health Surveys (ACHS I-2005-2007 and II, 2014) have linked these exposures with a variety of deletereous health outcomes. In addition to PCBs, these individuals were likely simultaneously exposed to other persistent organic pollutants including per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are an emerging class of ubiquitous industrial chemicals that are measurable in the blood of most individuals and have themselves been linked increased risk of some non communicable diseases.\nTo characterize PFAS exposures in ACHS I and ACHS II, we measured eight environmentally significant PFAS in serum by UPLC coupled electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Perfluorononanoate (PFNA), Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), and 4:2 Fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (4.2 FTS) were extracted from matched serum samples of individuals who participated in the original ACHS I (2005-2007; n\u00a0=\u00a0297) and the follow up ACHS II (2014; n\u00a0=\u00a0336). Data were collected in negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with monitoring of quantitation and qualifier ions for all target PFAS analytes, surrogates and internal standards. VARCLUS procedure was used to create hierarchical clusters between PFAS and other legacy persistent organic pollutants which may share similar exposure routes.\nOverall, circulating PFAS levels decreased approximately 50% from ACHS I (2005-2007) to ACHS II (2014), but these changes varied by compound. Mean levels of PFOS were >3 times higher in ACHS I subjects than in conpemporaneous NHANES subjects (2005-2006; ACHS I mean: 71.1\u00a0ng/ml; NHANES mean: 20.2\u00a0ng/mL), and this relationship persisted in ACHS II subjects (2014: ACHS II mean: 34.7\u00a0ng/ml; NHANES mean: 5.92\u00a0ng/mL). PFNA was also higher in both ACHS I and ACHS II subjects in comparision to NHANES whereas levels of PFOA and PFHxS were lower than in NHANES. Finally, cluster analysis revealed that in ACHS II, most PFAS tracked with polybrominated diphenyl ethers, except PFNA and PFHpA which clustered with industrial PCBs. In ACHS I, PFAS analytes correlated more closely with industrial PCBs and chlorinated pesticides.\nParticipants in the Anniston Community Health Surveys have higher levels of PFOS and PFNA than the general population with average PFOS levels >3 times contemporaneous NHANES levels. Since PFAS were not known to be manufactured in the area, more work needs to be completed to determine if population demographics, proximity to a military base, or regional manufacturing can explain the elevated levels.",

PFNA was also higher in both ACHS I and ACHS II subjects in comparision to NHANES whereas levels of PFOA and PFHxS were lower than in NHANES. Finally, cluster analysis revealed that in ACHS II, most PFAS tracked with polybrominated diphenyl ethers, except PFNA and PFHpA which clustered with industrial PCBs. In ACHS I, PFAS analytes correlated more closely with industrial PCBs and chlorinated pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to metal mixtures may lead to health impacts greater than the effects associated with singular exposures. Two common childhood environmental exposures, manganese (Mn) and lead (Pb), are associated with similar adverse neurodevelopmental effects; however, the effects surrounding concurrent exposure to both metals remain unclear. We study the impact of joint exposure to Mn and Pb on cognitive performance in school-aged children participating in the Communities Actively Researching Exposure Study (CARES) based in East Liverpool, Ohio. Blood Pb levels were measured for each child (geometric mean (GM)\u00a0=\u00a01.13\u00a0\u03bcg/dL, range 0.30\u00a0\u03bcg/dL - 6.64\u00a0\u03bcg/dL). Mn was measured in participant blood, hair, and toenails with GMs of 10.1\u00a0\u03bcg/L, 360\u00a0ng/g, 0.974\u00a0\u03bcg/g, respectively. Trained team members administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) to assess intelligence quotient (IQ). The WISC-IV provides scores for Full Scale IQ, Perceptual Reasoning, Processing Speed, Working Memory, and Verbal Comprehension. Interactions between blood Pb and all Mn biomarkers were tested in linear models adjusted for child sex, household income, and serum cotinine. Separate regression models were run for each of the Mn biomarkers. The cohort was comprised of 106 children with a mean age of 8.4 years. Interactions between blood Pb and hair Mn were significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for four out of the five IQ domains. The effect of blood Pb on IQ was more pronounced at higher levels of hair and toenail Mn. No significant associations were observed when characterizing the main effect of Mn using blood. Uncovering the health impacts associated with exposure mixtures is critical to understanding the impact of real-life conditions. Our findings suggest that joint exposure to Mn and Pb may produce heightened neurocognitive impacts even at blood Pb levels below the CDC reference concentration of 5\u00a0\u03bcg/dL.",

The Kentucky Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) will implement a type 1 hybrid effectiveness and implementation trial to examine an innovative MOUD pretreatment model using telehealth (alone and in combination with peer navigators) for justice-involved women in transition from jail to the community. The overall goal of the project is to increase initiation and maintenance of MOUD among high-risk justice-involved women during community reentry to reduce opioid relapse and overdose. This project and other studies through the JCOIN network have the potential to significantly impact the OUD treatment field by contributing empirical evidence about the effectiveness and implementation of innovative technologies to increase initiation and maintenance of MOUD during a critical, high-risk time of community reentry among vulnerable, justice-involved individuals in both urban and nonurban communities.",

    "abstract": "Maternal obesity is a significant public health concern that contributes to unfavorable outcomes such as inflammation and insulin resistance. Women with obesity may have impaired metabolic flexibility (i.e. an inability to adjust substrate metabolism according to fuel availability). Impaired metabolic flexibility during pregnancy may mediate poor pregnancy outcomes in women with obesity.\nThe purposes of this study were to: 1) compare metabolic flexibility between overweight/obese and lean women; and 2) determine the relationships between metabolic flexibility, inflammation following a high-fat meal, and maternal metabolic health outcomes (i.e. gestational weight gain and insulin resistance).\nThis interventional physiology study assessed lipid oxidation rates via indirect calorimetry before and after consumption of a high-fat meal. The percent change in lipid metabolism was calculated to determine 'metabolic flexibility.' Maternal inflammatory profiles (CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined via plasma analyses.\n64 women who were pregnant (lean\u202f=\u202f35, overweight/obese\u202f=\u202f29) participated between 32 and 38\u202fweeks gestation. Lean women had significantly higher metabolic flexibility compared to overweight/obese women (lean 48.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f34.1% vs overweight/obese 29.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f34.3%, p\u202f=\u202f.035). Even when controlling for pre-pregnancy BMI, there was a negative relationship between metabolic flexibility and percent change in CRP among the overweight/obese group (r\u202f=\u202f-0.526, p\u202f=\u202f.017). Metabolic flexibility (per kg fat free mass) was negatively correlated with postprandial HOMA-IR (2\u202fh: r\u202f=\u202f-0.325, p\u202f=\u202f.016; 4\u202fh: r\u202f=\u202f-0.319, p\u202f=\u202f.019).\nOverweight and obese women who are pregnant are less 'metabolically flexible' than lean women, and this is related to postprandial inflammation and insulin resistance.",

Innovative biomarkers, including those from neuroimaging, were incorporated into many of these studies to assess both manganese exposure and neurologic outcomes. A variety of health effects were evaluated, including cognitive and motor impairments. Studies of community participants residing near manganese point sources show variability in outcomes, reflecting the complexities of exposure measurement, individual absorption, and assessment of neurologic effects. The aging population provides insight into the impacts of chronic exposure in younger populations.",

    "abstract": "Selective separation of lignin depolymerization products is key to fractionating and isolating high-value aromatic compounds from the depolymerization process. The primary aim of this study was to synthesis graphene oxide (GO) membranes for selective separations of lignin oligomeric units from polar organic solvent-water media. GO membranes were synthesized on a polymeric substrate by a shear assisted casting of aqueous GO dispersion using a wire-wound rod. Deposited GO was then reduced to different extents by controlled thermal incubation, and the impact on membrane performance was investigated. The extent of reduction of GO was established by extensive characterization with FTIR, XPS, Raman Spectroscopy, XRD, and contact angle measurements. Impressive performance with the rejection of over 70% for the model compound trimer BMP (2,6-bis[(2-hydroxy-5-methyl phenyl) methyl]-4-methylphenol) was achieved compared to only 20% rejection for the dimer GGE (guaiacylglycerol-\u03b2-guaiacylether) with isopropanol-water (90-10% by volume) as a solvent. This corresponds to an encouraging selective separation with selective permeation of dimer (GGE) 3.5 times higher compared to trimer (BMP). rGO membranes exhibited a stable performance over 84 h of operation at a shear rate of 1.1 Pa in a cross-flow mode of operation. Selective separation of GO can be effectively modulated by controlling the O/C ratio by the extent of reduction of GO; indeed, the retention of trimeric compounds increased with increasing GO reduction. The remarkable performance of GO membranes could enable energy-efficient fractionation of lignin oligomeric compounds from polar organic solvents.",

Exposure to these chemicals is ubiquitous, and can lead to potential synergistic adverse effects in individuals exposed to both classes of chemicals. The present study was designed to identify interactions between PCB126 and PFOS that might promote acute changes in inflammatory pathways associated with cardiovascular disease and liver injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to vehicle, PCB126, PFOS, or a mixture of both pollutants. Plasma and liver samples were collected at 48\u00a0h after exposure. Changes in the expression of hepatic genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerosis were investigated. Plasma and liver samples was analyzed using untargeted lipidomic method. Hepatic mRNA levels for Nqo1, Icam1, and PAI1 were significantly increased in the mixture-exposed mice. Plasma levels of PAI1, a marker of fibrosis and thrombosis, were also significantly elevated in the mixture-exposed group. Liver injury was observed only in the mixture-exposed mice. Lipidomic analysis revealed that co-exposure to the mixture enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation and elevated oxidized phospholipids levels. In summary, this study shows that acute co-exposure to PCB126 and PFOS in mice results in liver injury and increased cardiovascular disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) initiates pathological inflammation which aggravates tissue damage and causes heart failure. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), produced by autotaxin (ATX), promotes inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis. The role of ATX/LPA signaling nexus in cardiac inflammation and resulting adverse cardiac remodeling is poorly understood.\nWe assessed autotaxin activity and LPA levels in relation to cardiac and systemic inflammation in AMI patients and C57BL/6 (WT) mice. Human and murine peripheral blood and cardiac tissue samples showed elevated levels of ATX activity, LPA, and inflammatory cells following AMI and there was strong correlation between LPA levels and circulating inflammatory cells. In a gain of function model, lipid phosphate phosphatase-3 (LPP3) specific inducible knock out (Mx1-Plpp3\nATX/LPA signaling nexus plays an important role in modulating inflammation after AMI and targeting this mechanism represents a novel therapeutic target for patients presenting with acute myocardial injury.",

    "abstract": "While metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes are costly and deadly to the current population, they are also extremely detrimental to the next generation. Much of the current literature focuses on the negative impact of poor maternal choices on offspring disease, while there is little work examining maternal behaviors that may improve offspring health. Research has shown that voluntary maternal exercise in mouse models improves metabolic function in offspring. In this study, we hypothesized that controlled maternal exercise in a mouse model will effect positive change on offspring obesity and glucose homeostasis. Female mice were separated into three groups: home cage, sedentary, and exercise. The sedentary home cage group was not removed from the home cage, while the sedentary wheel group was removed from the cage and placed in an immobile wheel apparatus. The exercise group was removed from the home cage and run on the same wheel apparatus but with the motor activated at 5-10 m/min for 1 h/d prior to and during pregnancy. Offspring were subjected to oral glucose tolerance testing and body composition analysis. There was no significant difference in offspring glucose tolerance or body composition as a consequence of the maternal exercise intervention compared to the sedentary wheel group. There were no marked negative consequences of the maternal controlled exercise intervention. Further research should clarify the potential advantages of the controlled exercise model and improve experimental techniques to facilitate translation of this research to human applications.",

    "abstract": "The availability of large healthcare datasets offers the opportunity for researchers to navigate the traditional clinical and translational science research stages in a nonlinear manner. In particular, data scientists can harness the power of large healthcare datasets to bridge from preclinical discoveries (T0) directly to assessing population-level health impact (T4). A successful bridge from T0 to T4 does not bypass the other stages entirely; rather, effective team science makes a direct progression from T0 to T4 impactful by incorporating the perspectives of researchers from every stage of the clinical and translational science research spectrum. In this exemplar, we demonstrate how effective team science overcame challenges and, ultimately, ensured success when a diverse team of researchers worked together, using healthcare big data to test population-level substance use disorder (SUD) hypotheses generated from preclinical rodent studies. This project, called Advancing Substance use disorder Knowledge using Big Data (ASK Big Data), highlights the critical roles that data science expertise and effective team science play in quickly translating preclinical research into public health impact.",

    "abstract": "Prior to the COVID pandemic, many CTSAs employed face-to-face interactions to conduct most of their community engagement (CE) activities. During the COVID pandemic, such engagement had to be curtailed and alternatives needed to be formulated. In addition, Community Engaged Research (CEnR) teams refocused their efforts to address this public health crisis.\nTo obtain a general understanding of how CTSAs have conducted CE and CEnR during the COVID pandemic, we invited seven CTSA CE leaders to provide brief field reports of their activities during the pandemic. This included how their approaches to CE and CEnR were modified during the COVID-19 pandemic and key lessons learned.\nWe found that despite numerous challenges, all seven CTSAs CE cores were able to successfully carry out CE and CEnR. We also found that the fundamental principles of meaningful and authentic stakeholder engagement were of paramount importance during the pandemic. Through virtual approaches, all sites had considerable success in maintaining CE in during the COVID pandemic. They also leveraged existing bi-directional community partnerships to carry out meaningful and impactful research. This included both new COVID CEnR and also innovative approaches to sustain prior non-COVID research.\nThese findings suggest that academic-community partnerships must be fostered and sustained over the many years so that when such crises emerge, all partners can build on existing trust and mutual respect. The lessons learned and the new tools and approaches developed would be key in addressing any such future public health emergencies.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of polyamine metabolism has been linked to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying mechanism is incompletely characterized. Here, we report that spermine synthase (SMS), a polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, is overexpressed in CRC. Targeted disruption of SMS in CRC cells results in spermidine accumulation, which inhibits FOXO3a acetylation and allows subsequent translocation to the nucleus to transcriptionally induce expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim. However, this induction is blunted by MYC-driven expression of miR-19a and miR-19b that repress Bim production. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MYC activity in SMS-depleted CRC cells dramatically induces Bim expression and apoptosis and causes tumor regression, but these effects are profoundly attenuated by silencing Bim. These findings uncover a key survival signal in CRC through convergent repression of Bim expression by distinct SMS- and MYC-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, combined inhibition of SMS and MYC signaling may be an effective therapy for CRC.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the normal development of many organs, including the brain. Although its roles as a cofactor in several enzymes and in maintaining optimal physiology are well-known, the overall biological functions of Mn are rather poorly understood. Alterations in body Mn status are associated with altered neuronal physiology and cognition in humans, and either overexposure or (more rarely) insufficiency can cause neurological dysfunction. The resultant balancing act can be viewed as a hormetic U-shaped relationship for biological Mn status and optimal brain health, with changes in the brain leading to physiological effects throughout the body and vice versa. This review discusses Mn homeostasis, biomarkers, molecular mechanisms of cellular transport, and neuropathological changes associated with disruptions of Mn homeostasis, especially in its excess, and identifies gaps in our understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying Mn homeostasis and neurotoxicity.",

Quality issues in GO, if not addressed, can cause misleading results or missed biological discoveries. Manual identification of potential quality issues in GO is a challenging and arduous task, given its growing size. We introduce an automated auditing approach for suggesting potentially missing is-a relations, which may further reveal erroneous is-a relations.\nWe developed a Subsumption-based Sub-term Inference Framework (SSIF) by leveraging a novel term-algebra on top of a sequence-based representation of GO concepts along with three conditional rules (monotonicity, intersection and sub-concept rules). Applying SSIF to the October 3, 2018 release of GO suggested 1938 unique potentially missing is-a relations. Domain experts evaluated a random sample of 210 potentially missing is-a relations. The results showed SSIF achieved a precision of 60.61, 60.49 and 46.03% for the monotonicity, intersection and sub-concept rules, respectively.\nSSIF is implemented in Java.

    "abstract": "Cancer somatic driver mutations associated with genes within a pathway often show a mutually exclusive pattern across a cohort of patients. This mutually exclusive mutational signal has been frequently used to distinguish driver from passenger mutations and to investigate relationships among driver mutations. Current methods for de novo discovery of mutually exclusive mutational patterns are limited because the heterogeneity in background mutation rate can confound mutational patterns, and the presence of highly mutated genes can lead to spurious patterns. In addition, most methods only focus on a limited number of pre-selected genes and are unable to perform genome-wide analysis due to computational inefficiency.\nWe introduce a statistical framework, MEScan, for accurate and efficient mutual exclusivity analysis at the genomic scale. Our framework contains a fast and powerful statistical test for mutual exclusivity with adjustment of the background mutation rate and impact of highly mutated genes, and a multi-step procedure for genome-wide screening with the control of false discovery rate.

    "abstract": "The association of delay in seeking medical care to subsequent cardiac events remains unknown in patients with worsening heart failure (HF) symptoms. The aims of this study were to (i) identify factors predicting care-seeking delay and (ii) examine the impact of care-seeking delay on subsequent cardiac rehospitalization or death.\nWe studied 153 patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of HF. Potential predictors of delay including demographic, clinical, psychosocial, cognitive, and behavioural variables were collected. Patients were followed for 3\u2009months after discharge to determine time to the first cardiac rehospitalization or death. The median delay time was 134\u2009h (25th and 75th percentiles 49 and 364\u2009h). Non-linear regression showed that New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (P\u2009=\u20090.001), worse depressive symptoms (P\u2009=\u20090.004), better HF knowledge (P\u2009=\u20090.003), and lower perceived somatic awareness (P\u2009=\u20090.033) were predictors of delay time from patient perception of worsening HF to subsequent hospital admission. Cox regression revealed that patients who delayed longer (more than 134\u2009h) had a 1.93-fold higher risk of experiencing cardiac events (P\u2009=\u20090.044) compared to non-delayers.\nCare-seeking delay in patients with worsening HF symptoms was significantly associated with an increased risk of rehospitalization and mortality after discharge. Intervention strategies addressing functional status, psychological state, cognitive and behavioural factors are essential to reduce delay and thereby improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer treatments often result in upper extremity functional limitations in both the short and long term. Current evidence makes comparisons against a baseline or contralateral limb, but does not consider changes in function associated with aging.\nThe objective of this study was to compare upper extremity function between women treated for breast cancer more than 12\u00a0months in the past and women without cancer.\nThis was an observational cross-sectional study.\nWomen who were diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mean post-surgical treatment time of 51\u00a0months (range\u00a0=\u00a012-336\u00a0months) were compared with women who did not have breast cancer (CTRL group). Self-reported upper extremity function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and shoulder range of motion, strength, and muscular endurance were measured. Participants were divided into 3 groups: breast cancer involving the nondominant limb (BC-ND), breast cancer involving the dominant limb (BC-DOM), and CTRL.\nA total of 59 women in the CTRL group, 23 women in the BC-ND group, and 28 women in the BC-DOM group completed measures. Mean DASH scores in women with breast cancer were higher than those of women in the CTRL group, regardless of the limb on which cancer occurred (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.13; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.20 to 16.21) Range of motion for the BC-ND group was significantly less for flexion (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.19, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-13.08 to -0.11) and external rotation (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.11, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-18.62 to -1.98) compared with the CTRL group. Strength in the BC-ND group was 23% to 25% lower in the CTRL group for external (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.09 to 0.12) and internal rotation (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a00.92, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.10 to 0.13). Endurance was not significantly different in the 3 groups.\nSome participants had rehabilitation, which may have skewed results. The range of post-surgical treatment times was broad, making it difficult to determine when function returned. Muscular endurance measures demonstrated a ceiling effect and large variance, limiting the ability to distinguish differences among participants. These results may not be generalizable to the subset of women who were treated with lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, or chest wall radiation alone or who underwent a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.\nIn the long term, women with breast cancer have lower self-reported shoulder function than women without breast cancer. Motion and strength are lower among women who have experienced cancer on the nondominant limb.",

    "abstract": "Cadmium exposure is ubiquitous and has been linked to diseases including cancers and reproductive defects. Since cadmium is nonmutagenic, it is thought to exert its gene dysregulatory effects through epigenetic reprogramming. Several studies have implicated germline exposure to cadmium in developmental reprogramming. However, most of these studies have focused on maternal exposure, while the impact on sperm fertility and disease susceptibility has received less attention. In this study, we used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to comprehensively investigate the impact of chronic cadmium exposure on mouse spermatozoa DNA methylation. Adult male C57BL/J6 mice were provided water with or without cadmium chloride for 9 weeks. Sperm, testes, liver, and kidney tissues were collected at the end of the treatment period. Cadmium exposure was confirmed through gene expression analysis of metallothionein-1 and 2, 2 well-known cadmium-induced genes. Analysis of sperm DNA methylation changes revealed 1788 differentially methylated sites present at regulatory regions in sperm of mice exposed to cadmium compared with vehicle (control) mice. Furthermore, most of these differential methylation changes positively correlated with changes in gene expression at both the transcription initiation stage as well as the splicing levels. Interestingly, the genes targeted by cadmium exposure are involved in several critical developmental processes. Our results present a comprehensive analysis of the sperm methylome in response to chronic cadmium exposure. These data, therefore, highlight a foundational framework to study gene expression patterns that may affect fertility in the exposed individual as well as their offspring, through paternal inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Local health departments (LHDs) operate within complex, multisectoral organizational communication networks. Network composition may affect priorities, processes, and the reach of health information to key stakeholders. This study seeks to elucidate variation in local network structures to examine how different constellations may affect information sharing across audiences.\nThis study analyzes data from a 2016 US survey of 491 metropolitan LHDs and 556 nonmetropolitan LHDs. Researchers first conducted social network analysis of network density, defined as the total number of potential organizations contributing to a jurisdiction's health communication activities. Researchers then conducted logistic regression to compare the relationship between network density and reported health communication activities targeting 3 specific audiences: policy makers, lay publics, and mass media.\nThree network types emerged on the basis of the number of organizations that contribute to health communication activities, with low-density Minimal networks more common in nonmetropolitan jurisdictions and higher-density Expanded and Robust networks more common in metropolitan jurisdictions. LHDs in Minimal networks were significantly less likely to communicate with policy makers, lay publics, and mass media than their counterparts in higher-density networks (P < .05).\nLHDs are embedded in organizational communication networks that vary in both the number of communication partners and the types of audiences reached. Examining their own local organizational communication networks may provide insights into LHDs that wish to improve the effectiveness of public health messaging. By adding organizational communication partners and reaching new audiences, LHDs in Minimal networks can expand the reach of messages designed to help policy makers, communities, and individuals promote health and prevent disease.",

The purpose of this study was to describe a profile of rural caregivers of patients with chronic illnesses to determine the prevalence of CVD risk factors, and psychosocial and socioeconomic burden, as well as to compare these variables across gender.\nBaseline data from a trial of CVD risk reduction in rural caregivers of patients with chronic illnesses were used. We measured depression and anxiety with the PHQ-9 and Brief Symptom Inventory; social, economic, and environmental factors using the MOS-Social Support and Economic and Environmental surveys; body mass index (BMI); blood pressure (BP); and lipid profile.\nOf 181 caregivers (age 53\u00b114 years, 80% female), 69% were married; 88% were caring for a family member, including 46% caring for a spouse and 18% for a parent. A total of 51% were anxious, 25% depressed, and 25% reported lack of social support. Most (51%) caregivers had one or more types of CVD; and 49% were smokers. By examination, 76% had elevated BP; 35% had total cholesterol >200; 50% low-density lipoprotein >100; 56% triglycerides >150; and 79% high-density lipoprotein <60. Based on BMI, 91.5% were overweight or obese. Gender comparisons revealed that women reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than men.\nRural caregivers, regardless of gender, are at increased risk of CVD and struggle with factors that make caregiving burdensome and contribute to their own poor cardiac health.",

    "abstract": "Platelet transfusion is a life-saving therapy to prevent or treat bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. However, for >6 decades, safe and effective strategies for platelet storage have been an impediment to widespread use of platelet transfusion. Refrigerated platelets are cleared rapidly from circulation, precluding cold storage of platelets for transfusion. Consequently, platelets are stored at room temperature with an upper limit of 5 days due to risks of bacterial contamination and loss of platelet function. This practice severely limits platelet availability for transfusion. This study is to identify the mechanism of platelet clearance after cold storage and develop a method for platelet cold storage. Approach and Results: We found that rapid clearance of cold-stored platelets was largely due to integrin activation and apoptosis. Deficiency of integrin \u03b23 or caspase-3 prolonged cold-stored platelets in circulation. Pretreatment of platelets with EGTA, a cell impermeable calcium ion chelator, reversely inhibited cold storage-induced platelet activation and consequently prolonged circulation of cold-stored platelets. Moreover, transfusion of EGTA-treated, cold-stored platelets, but not room temperature-stored platelets, into the mice deficient in glycoprotein Ib\u03b1 significantly shortened tail-bleeding times and diminished blood loss.\nIntegrin activation and apoptosis is the underlying mechanism of rapid clearance of platelets after cold storage. Addition of a cell impermeable calcium ion chelator to platelet products is potentially a simple and effective method to enable cold storage of platelets for transfusion.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBeige adipose tissue is associated with improved glucose homeostasis in mice. Adipose tissue contains \u03b23-adrenergic receptors (\u03b23-ARs), and this study was intended to determine whether the treatment of obese, insulin-resistant humans with the \u03b23-AR agonist mirabegron, which stimulates beige adipose formation in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC WAT), would induce other beneficial changes in fat and muscle and improve metabolic homeostasis.METHODSBefore and after \u03b23-AR agonist treatment, oral glucose tolerance tests and euglycemic clamps were performed, and histochemical analysis and gene expression profiling were performed on fat and muscle biopsies. PET-CT scans quantified brown adipose tissue volume and activity, and we conducted in vitro studies with primary cultures of differentiated human adipocytes and muscle.RESULTSThe clinical effects of mirabegron treatment included improved oral glucose tolerance (P < 0.01), reduced hemoglobin A1c levels (P = 0.01), and improved insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03) and \u03b2 cell function (P = 0.01). In SC WAT, mirabegron treatment stimulated lipolysis, reduced fibrotic gene expression, and increased alternatively activated macrophages. Subjects with the most SC WAT beiging showed the greatest improvement in \u03b2 cell function. In skeletal muscle, mirabegron reduced triglycerides, increased the expression of PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1 \u03b1 (PGC1A) (P < 0.05), and increased type I fibers (P < 0.01). Conditioned media from adipocytes treated with mirabegron stimulated muscle fiber PGC1A expression in vitro (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONMirabegron treatment substantially improved multiple measures of glucose homeostasis in obese, insulin-resistant humans. Since \u03b2 cells and skeletal muscle do not express \u03b23-ARs, these data suggest that the beiging of SC WAT by mirabegron reduces adipose tissue dysfunction, which enhances muscle oxidative capacity and improves \u03b2 cell function.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicaltrials.gov NCT02919176.FUNDINGNIH: DK112282, P30GM127211, DK 71349, and Clinical and Translational science Awards (CTSA) grant UL1TR001998.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBeige and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are associated with improved metabolic homeostasis. We recently reported that the \u03b23-adrenergic receptor agonist mirabegron induced beige adipose tissue in obese insulin-resistant subjects, and this was accompanied by improved glucose metabolism. Here we evaluated pioglitazone treatment with a combination pioglitazone and mirabegron treatment and compared these with previously published data evaluating mirabegron treatment alone. Both drugs were used at FDA-approved dosages.METHODSWe measured BAT by PET CT scans, measured beige adipose tissue by immunohistochemistry, and comprehensively characterized glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by euglycemic clamp and oral glucose tolerance tests. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue, muscle fiber type composition and capillary density, lipotoxicity, and systemic inflammation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling, mass spectroscopy, and ELISAs.RESULTSTreatment with pioglitazone or the combination of pioglitazone and mirabegron increased beige adipose tissue protein marker expression and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, but neither treatment induced BAT in these obese subjects. When the magnitude of the responses to the treatments was evaluated, mirabegron was found to be the most effective at inducing beige adipose tissue. Although monotherapy with either mirabegron or pioglitazone induced adipose beiging, combination treatment resulted in less beiging than either alone. The 3 treatments also had different effects on muscle fiber type switching and capillary density.CONCLUSIONThe addition of pioglitazone to mirabegron treatment does not enhance beiging or increase BAT in obese insulin-resistant research participants.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02919176.FUNDINGNIH DK112282 and P20GM103527 and Clinical and Translational Science Awards grant UL1TR001998.",

    "abstract": "Sexual violence perpetration (SVP), including coerced, physically forced, and alcohol- or drug-facilitated unwanted sex, occurs frequently in adolescence and may represent a risk factor for future perpetration. Sexual violence victimization (SVV) has been found to be a risk factor for increased rates of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, the associations of SVP with depression or posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been less well described. This study examined associations between symptoms of depression and PTSS with SVP in the prior 12 months among high school students. In this cross-sectional analysis, a representative sample of public high school students (ninth-12th grades) completed self-reported surveys on peer SVP and SVV within the past year. Among 16,784 students completing surveys, 7.2% disclosed SVP against another high school student in the past 12 months; 64.4% of students disclosing SVP also experienced SVV. Both SVP and SVV, alone or in combination, were associated with a greater likelihood of symptoms of depression or PTSS. These associations were similar by sex and sexual minority status (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer [LGBTQ+]). These findings highlight the need for continued primary prevention efforts. Additional screening to recognize adolescent SVP can allow both early treatment of depression and PTSD and address the individual risks of SVP to reduce subsequent repeated sexual assaults.",

Investigators have reported equivocal findings regarding the association of hostility with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) recurrence and mortality. Given mixed results on the relationship between hostility and cardiovascular outcomes, further research is critical.\nThe aim of our study was to determine whether hostility was a predictor of ACS recurrence and mortality.\nWe performed a secondary analysis of data (N = 2321) from a large randomized clinical trial of an intervention designed to reduce pre-hospital delay among patients who were experiencing ACS. Hostility was measured at baseline with the Multiple Adjective Affect Checklist (MAACL) and patients were followed for 24 months for evaluation of ACS recurrence and all-cause mortality. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to determine whether hostility was predictive of time to ACS recurrence or all-cause mortality.\nThe majority of patients were married (73%), Caucasian (97%), men (68%), and had a mean age of 67 \u00b1 11 years. Fifty-seven percent of participants scored as hostile based on the established MAACL cut point (mean score = 7.56 \u00b1 3.8). Hostility was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (p = < 0.039), but was not a predictor of ACS recurrence (p = 0.792).\nHostility is common in patients with ACS and its relationship to clinical outcomes is important to the design of future interventions to improve long-term ACS mortality.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is the process by which germ cells develop into spermatozoa in the testis. Sperm protamines are small, arginine-rich nuclear proteins which replace somatic histones during spermatogenesis, allowing a hypercondensed DNA state that leads to a smaller nucleus and facilitating sperm head formation. In eutherian mammals, the protamine-DNA complex is achieved through a combination of intra- and intermolecular cysteine cross-linking and possibly histidine-cysteine zinc ion binding. Most metatherian sperm protamines lack cysteine but perform the same function. This lack of dicysteine cross-linking has made the mechanism behind metatherian protamines folding unclear.\nProtamine sequences from UniProt's databases were pulled down and sorted into homologous groups. Multiple sequence alignments were then generated and a gap weighted relative entropy score calculated for each position. For the eutherian alignments, the cysteine containing positions were the most highly conserved. For the metatherian alignment, the tyrosine containing positions were the most highly conserved and corresponded to the cysteine positions in the eutherian alignment.\nHigh conservation indicates likely functionally/structurally important residues at these positions in the metatherian protamines and the correspondence with cysteine positions within the eutherian alignment implies a similarity in function. One possible explanation is that the metatherian protamine structure relies upon dityrosine cross-linking between these highly conserved tyrosines. Also, the human protamine P1 sequence has a tyrosine substitution in a position expecting eutherian dicysteine cross-linking. Similarly, some members of the metatherian Planigales genus contain cysteine substitutions in positions expecting plausible metatherian dityrosine cross-linking. Rare cysteine-tyrosine cross-linking could explain both observations.",

    "abstract": "Deviations from gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations are associated with unfavorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. There is a need to understand how maternal substrate metabolism, independent of weight status, may contribute to GWG and neonatal outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential link between maternal lipid oxidation rate, GWG, and neonatal anthropometric outcomes.\nWomen (N\u2009=\u200932) with a lean pre-pregnancy BMI were recruited during late pregnancy and substrate metabolism was assessed using indirect calorimetry, before and after consumption of a high-fat meal. GWG was categorized as follows: inadequate, adequate, or excess. Shortly after delivery (within 48\u00a0h), neonatal anthropometrics were obtained.\nUsing ANOVA, we found that fasting maternal lipid oxidation rate (grams/minute) was higher (p\u2009=\u20090.003) among women with excess GWG (0.1019\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0416) compared to women without excess GWG (inadequate\u2009=\u20090.0586\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0273, adequate\u2009=\u20090.0569\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0238). Findings were similar when lipid oxidation was assessed post-meal and also when expressed relative to kilograms of fat free mass. Absolute GWG was positively correlated to absolute lipid oxidation expressed in grams/minute at baseline (r\u2009=\u20090.507, p\u2009=\u20090.003), 2\u00a0h post-meal (r\u2009=\u20090.531, p\u2009=\u20090.002), and 4\u00a0h post-meal (r\u2009=\u20090.546, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Fasting and post-meal lipid oxidation (grams/minute) were positively correlated to neonatal birthweight (fasting r\u2009=\u20090.426, p\u2009=\u20090.015; 2-hour r\u2009=\u20090.393, p\u2009=\u20090.026; 4-hour r\u2009=\u20090.540, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and also to neonatal absolute fat mass (fasting r\u2009=\u20090.493, p\u2009=\u20090.004; 2-hour r\u2009=\u20090.450, p\u2009=\u20090.010; 4-hour r\u2009=\u20090.552, p\u2009=\u20090.001).\nA better understanding of the metabolic profile of women during pregnancy may be critical in truly understanding a woman's risk of GWG outside the recommendations. GWG counseling during prenatal care may need to be tailored to women based not just on their weight status, but other metabolic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "To slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, businesses shutdown in Spring 2020. Research has indicated the impact on frontlines workers, yet little is known about the impact on those who were not working outside the home or switched to working remotely.\nThe purpose of this report is to identify the financial and healthcare issues and mental health impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on Appalachians by worker categories.\nAn online survey was administered from May 8 - June 6, 2020 to a convenience sample of previous research participants and shared through social media networks, i.e., snowball sampling. Questions investigated mental health, financial and healthcare issues, and employment status. Survey responses were summarized by percentages overall and by working categories.\nOf the 751 participants, 276 (42%) resided in Appalachia. After removing 17 who lost their job due to COVID-19, 59 (23%) indicated not working outside the home prior to COVID-19, whereas 111 (43%) and 89 (34%) switched to working remotely and continued working outside the home during the shutdown. Respondents were predominately Caucasian and female. Nearly a quarter of participants had lost or reduced income due to the shutdown. Approximately half missed or postponed healthcare appointments. Mental health impacts were similar across the groups, with half of the respondents reporting anxiety due to COVID-19.\nFurther research is needed to explore health outcomes associated with missed healthcare appointments during the shutdown. Mental health support may be needed equally by those isolated at home and frontline workers.",

    "abstract": "Gene Ontology is used extensively in scientific knowledgebases and repositories to organize a wealth of biological information. However, interpreting annotations derived from differential gene lists is often difficult without manually sorting into higher-order categories. To address these issues, we present GOcats, a novel tool that organizes the Gene Ontology (GO) into subgraphs representing user-defined concepts, while ensuring that all appropriate relations are congruent with respect to scoping semantics. We tested GOcats performance using subcellular location categories to mine annotations from GO-utilizing knowledgebases and evaluated their accuracy against immunohistochemistry datasets in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). In comparison to term categorizations generated from UniProt's controlled vocabulary and from GO slims via OWLTools' Map2Slim, GOcats outperformed these methods in its ability to mimic human-categorized GO term sets. Unlike the other methods, GOcats relies only on an input of basic keywords from the user (e.g. biologist), not a manually compiled or static set of top-level GO terms. Additionally, by identifying and properly defining relations with respect to semantic scope, GOcats can utilize the traditionally problematic relation, has_part, without encountering erroneous term mapping. We applied GOcats in the comparison of HPA-sourced knowledgebase annotations to experimentally-derived annotations provided by HPA directly. During the comparison, GOcats improved correspondence between the annotation sources by adjusting semantic granularity. GOcats enables the creation of custom, GO slim-like filters to map fine-grained gene annotations from gene annotation files to general subcellular compartments without needing to hand-select a set of GO terms for categorization. Moreover, GOcats can customize the level of semantic specificity for annotation categories. Furthermore, GOcats enables a safe and more comprehensive semantic scoping utilization of go-core, allowing for a more complete utilization of information available in GO. Together, these improvements can impact a variety of GO knowledgebase data mining use-cases as well as knowledgebase curation and quality control.",

    "abstract": "High-quality three-dimensional structural data is of great value for the functional interpretation of biomacromolecules, especially proteins; however, structural quality varies greatly across the entries in the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). Since 2008, the wwPDB has required the inclusion of structure factors with the deposition of x-ray crystallographic structures to support the independent evaluation of structures with respect to the underlying experimental data used to derive those structures. However, interpreting the discrepancies between the structural model and its underlying electron density data is difficult, since derived sigma-scaled electron density maps use arbitrary electron density units which are inconsistent between maps from different wwPDB entries. Therefore, we have developed a method that converts electron density values from sigma-scaled electron density maps into units of electrons. With this conversion, we have developed new methods that can evaluate specific regions of an x-ray crystallographic structure with respect to a physicochemical interpretation of its corresponding electron density map. We have systematically compared all deposited x-ray crystallographic protein models in the wwPDB with their underlying electron density maps, if available, and characterized the electron density in terms of expected numbers of electrons based on the structural model. The methods generated coherent evaluation metrics throughout all PDB entries with associated electron density data, which are consistent with visualization software that would normally be used for manual quality assessment. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to derive units of electrons directly from electron density maps without the aid of the underlying structure factors. These new metrics are biochemically-informative and can be extremely useful for filtering out low-quality structural regions from inclusion into systematic analyses that span large numbers of PDB entries. Furthermore, these new metrics will improve the ability of non-crystallographers to evaluate regions of interest within PDB entries, since only the PDB structure and the associated electron density maps are needed. These new methods are available as a well-documented Python package on GitHub and the Python Package Index under a modified Clear BSD open source license.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of incident blindness among working-age adults in the United States. Federally designated safety-net clinics (FDSC) often serve as point-of-contact for patients least likely to receive recommended DR screenings, creating opportunity for targeted interventions to increase screening access and compliance.\nWith such a goal, we implemented and assessed the longitudinal performance of an FDSC-based telemedicine DR screening (TDRS) network of 22 clinical sites providing nonmydriatic fundus photography with remote interpretation and reporting. Retrospective analysis of patient encounters between February 2014 and January 2019 was performed to assess rates of pathology and referral. A generalized estimating equation logistic regression model was used for subset analysis from audits of pre- and post-implementation screening rates. Finally, patient surveys were conducted and assessed as a measure of intervention acceptability.\nOf the 13,923 individual telescreening encounters (4327 female, 4220 male, and 5376 unspecified; mean [SD] age, 54.9 [12.5] years) studied, 10,540 were of adequate quality to identify 3532 (33.5%) patients with ocular pathology: 2319 (22.0%) patients had some level of DR with 1604 (15.2%) requiring specialist referral, and 808 (7.7%) patients required referral for other ocular pathologies. The mean screening rate for audited clinics in the year prior to program implementation was 29.9% (641/2147), which increased to 47.7% (1012/2124) in the program's first year, doubling patients' odds of being screened (OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.7; P = .003). These gains were sustained over four years following implementation (OR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1; P = .018) despite varied clinic screening performance (4-year averaged range, 22.9-55.1%). Odds of early detection likewise doubled for patients with consecutive screenings (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 2.0-2.4; P < .001). Finally, surveyed patients preferred TDRS to specialist exams (82.5%; 776/941) and would recommend the service to friends (92.7%; 868/936).\nA statewide, FDSC-centered TDRS network was successfully established and sustained in a medically underserved region of the United States. Our results suggest that large TDRS networks in FDSCs can increase screening access and compliance for otherwise unscreened populations, but outcomes can vary greatly among clinics. Further work to optimize program implementation is needed to maximize this model's impact.",

    "abstract": "In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, United States (U.S.) educational institutions must weigh incomplete scientific evidence to inform decisions about how best to re-open schools without sacrificing public health. While many communities face surging case numbers, others are experiencing case plateaus or even decreasing numbers. Simultaneously, some U.S. school systems face immense infrastructure challenges and resource constraints, while others are better positioned to resume face-to-face instruction. In this review, we first examine potential engineering controls to reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposures; we then present processes whereby local decision-makers can identify and partner with scientists, faculty, students, parents, public health officials, and others to determine the controls most appropriate for their communities. While no solution completely eliminates risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and illness, this mini-review discusses engaged decision and communication processes that incorporate current scientific knowledge, school district constraints, local tolerance for health risk, and community priorities to help guide schools in selecting and implementing re-opening strategies that are acceptable, feasible, and context-specific.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to blast overpressure waves is implicated as the major cause of ocular injuries and resultant visual dysfunction in veterans involved in recent combat operations. No effective therapeutic strategies have been developed so far for blast-induced ocular dysfunction. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid generated by activated platelets, astrocytes, choroidal plexus cells, and microglia and is reported to play major roles in stimulating inflammatory processes. The levels of LPA in the cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to increase acutely in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model in mice. In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous administration of a monoclonal LPA antibody (25 mg/kg) given at 1 h post-blast for protection against injuries to the retina and associated ocular dysfunctions. Our results show that a single 19 psi blast exposure significantly increased the levels of several species of LPA in blood plasma at 1 and 4 h post-blast. The anti-LPA antibody treatment significantly decreased glial cell activation and preserved neuronal cell morphology in the retina on day 8 after blast exposure. Optokinetic measurements indicated that anti-LPA antibody treatment significantly improved visual acuity in both eyes on days 2 and 6 post-blast exposure. Anti-LPA antibody treatment significantly increased rod photoreceptor and bipolar neuronal cell signaling in both eyes on day 7 post-blast exposure. These results suggest that blast exposure triggers release of LPAs, which play a major role promoting blast-induced ocular injuries, and that a single early administration of anti-LPA antibodies provides significant protection.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency or excess exposure to manganese (Mn), an essential mineral, may have potentially adverse health effects. The kidneys are a major organ of Mn site-specific toxicity because of their unique role in filtration, metabolism, and excretion of xenobiotics. We hypothesized that Mn concentrations were associated with poorer blood pressure (BP) and kidney parameters such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1931 healthy U.S. adolescents aged 12-19 years participating in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2018. Blood and urine Mn concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Systolic and diastolic BP were calculated as the average of available readings. eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine using the Bedside Schwartz equation. We performed multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, race/ethnicity, and poverty income ratio. We observed null relationships between blood Mn concentrations with eGFR, ACR, BUN, and BP. In a subset of 691 participants, we observed that a 10-fold increase in urine Mn was associated with a 16.4 mL/min higher eGFR (95% Confidence Interval: 11.1, 21.7). These exploratory findings should be interpreted cautiously and warrant investigation in longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "Environmental health literacy (EHL) is developing as a framework that can inform educational interventions designed to facilitate individual and collective action to protect health, yet EHL measurement poses several challenges. While some studies have measured environmental health knowledge resulting from interventions, few have incorporated skills and self-efficacy. In this study, a process-focused EHL instrument was developed, using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy instrument as a model and tailoring it for the context of private well contamination with toxic metals. Forty-seven (47) participants, including undergraduate students and residents of communities with contaminated well water, piloted a prototype EHL instrument alongside NVS. Results suggested a moderate degree of correlation between NVS and the EHL prototype, and significant differences in scores were observed between students and residents. Responses to a self-efficacy survey, tailored for drinking water contaminated with arsenic, revealed significant differences between students and residents on items related to cost and distance. In response to open-ended questions, participants identified a range of potential environmental contaminants in drinking water and deemed varied information sources as reliable. This study highlights differences in knowledge and self-efficacy among students and residents and raises questions about the adequacy of EHL assessments that mimic formal education approaches.",

    "abstract": "Scandate cathodes have exhibited superior emission properties compared to current state-of-the-art \"M-type\" thermionic cathodes. However, their integration into vacuum devices is limited in part by a lack of knowledge regarding their functional lifespan and behavior during operation. Here, we consider thermal desorption from scandate cathodes by examining the distribution of material deposited on interior surfaces of a sealed vacuum device after ~26,000 h of cathode operation. XPS, EDS, and TEM analyses indicate that on the order of 1 wt.% of the initial impregnate is desorbed during a cathode's lifetime, Ca does not desorb uniformly with time, and little to no Sc desorbs from the cathode surfaces (or does so at an undetectable rate). Findings from this first-ever study of a scandate cathode after extremely long-time operation yield insight into the utility of scandate cathodes as components in vacuum devices and suggest possible effects on device performance due to deposition of desorption products on interior device surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Nanomaterials with tunable properties show promise because of their size-dependent electronic structure and controllable physical properties. The purpose of this research was to develop and validate environmentally safe nanomaterial-based approach for treatment of drinking water including removal and degradation of per- and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFAS). PFAS are surfactant chemicals with broad uses that are now recognized as contaminants with a significant risk to human health. They are commonly used in household and industrial products. They are extremely persistent in the environment because they possess both hydrophobic fluorine-saturated carbon chains and hydrophilic functional groups, along with being oleophobic. Traditional drinking water treatment technologies are usually ineffective for the removal of PFAS from contaminated waters, because they are normally present in exiguous concentrations and have unique properties that make them persistent. Therefore, there is a critical need for safe and efficient remediation methods for PFAS, particularly in drinking water. The proposed novel approach has also a potential application for decreasing PFAS background levels in analytical systems. In this study, nanocomposite membranes composed of sulfonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) and two-dimensional phosphorene were fabricated, and they obtained on average 99% rejection of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) alongside with a 99% removal from the PFOA that accumulated on surface of the membrane. The removal of PFOA accumulated on the membrane surface achieved 99% after the membranes were treated with ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and liquid aerobic oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) experiments use stable isotope tracers to provide superior metabolomics datasets for metabolic flux analysis and metabolic modeling. Since assumptions of model correctness can seriously compromise interpretation of metabolic flux results, we have developed a metabolic modeling software package specifically designed for moiety model comparison and selection based on the metabolomics data provided. Here, we tested the effectiveness of model selection with two time-series mass spectrometry (MS) isotopologue datasets for uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) generated from different platforms utilizing direct infusion nanoelectrospray and liquid chromatography. Analysis results demonstrate the robustness of our model selection methods by the successful selection of the optimal model from over 40 models provided. Moreover, the effects of specific optimization methods, degree of optimization, selection criteria, and specific objective functions on model selection are illustrated. Overall, these results indicate that over-optimization can lead to model selection failure, but combining multiple datasets can help control this overfitting effect. The implication is that SIRM datasets in public repositories of reasonable quality can be combined with newly acquired datasets to improve model selection. Furthermore, curation efforts of public metabolomics repositories to maintain high data quality could have a huge impact on future metabolic modeling efforts.",

    "abstract": "Despite instrument and algorithmic improvements, the untargeted and accurate assignment of metabolites remains an unsolved problem in metabolomics. New assignment methods such as our SMIRFE algorithm can assign elemental molecular formulas to observed spectral features in a highly untargeted manner without orthogonal information from tandem MS or chromatography. However, for many lipidomics applications, it is necessary to know at least the lipid category or class that is associated with a detected spectral feature to derive a biochemical interpretation. Our goal is to develop a method for robustly classifying elemental molecular formula assignments into lipid categories for an application to SMIRFE-generated assignments. Using a Random Forest machine learning approach, we developed a method that can predict lipid category and class from SMIRFE non-adducted molecular formula assignments. Our methods achieve high average predictive accuracy (>90%) and precision (>83%) across all eight of the lipid categories in the LIPIDMAPS database. Classification performance was evaluated using sets of theoretical, data-derived, and artifactual molecular formulas. Our methods enable the lipid classification of non-adducted molecular formula assignments generated by SMIRFE without orthogonal information, facilitating the biochemical interpretation of untargeted lipidomics experiments. This lipid classification appears insufficient for validating single-spectrum assignments, but could be useful in cross-spectrum assignment validation.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic flux analysis requires both a reliable metabolic model and reliable metabolic profiles in characterizing metabolic reprogramming. Advances in analytic methodologies enable production of high-quality metabolomics datasets capturing isotopic flux. However, useful metabolic models can be difficult to derive due to the lack of relatively complete atom-resolved metabolic networks for a variety of organisms, including human. Here, we developed a neighborhood-specific graph coloring method that creates unique identifiers for each atom in a compound facilitating construction of an atom-resolved metabolic network. What is more, this method is guaranteed to generate the same identifier for symmetric atoms, enabling automatic identification of possible additional mappings caused by molecular symmetry. Furthermore, a compound coloring identifier derived from the corresponding atom coloring identifiers can be used for compound harmonization across various metabolic network databases, which is an essential first step in network integration. With the compound coloring identifiers, 8865 correspondences between KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and MetaCyc compounds are detected, with 5451 of them confirmed by other identifiers provided by the two databases. In addition, we found that the Enzyme Commission numbers (EC) of reactions can be used to validate possible correspondence pairs, with 1848 unconfirmed pairs validated by commonality in reaction ECs. Moreover, we were able to detect various issues and errors with compound representation in KEGG and MetaCyc databases by compound coloring identifiers, demonstrating the usefulness of this methodology for database curation.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic models have been proven to be useful tools in system biology and have been successfully applied to various research fields in a wide range of organisms. A relatively complete metabolic network is a prerequisite for deriving reliable metabolic models. The first step in constructing metabolic network is to harmonize compounds and reactions across different metabolic databases. However, effectively integrating data from various sources still remains a big challenge. Incomplete and inconsistent atomistic details in compound representations across databases is a very important limiting factor. Here, we optimized a subgraph isomorphism detection algorithm to validate generic compound pairs. Moreover, we defined a set of harmonization relationship types between compounds to deal with inconsistent chemical details while successfully capturing atom-level characteristics, enabling a more complete enabling compound harmonization across metabolic databases. In total, 15,704 compound pairs across KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and MetaCyc databases were detected. Furthermore, utilizing the classification of compound pairs and EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers of reactions, we established hierarchical relationships between metabolic reactions, enabling the harmonization of 3856 reaction pairs. In addition, we created and used atom-specific identifiers to evaluate the consistency of atom mappings within and between harmonized reactions, detecting some consistency issues between the reaction and compound descriptions in these metabolic databases.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) represents 85% of newly diagnosed lung cancers. In this study, we utilized our untargeted assignment tool Small Molecule Isotope Resolved Formula Enumerator (SMIRFE) and ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry to examine lipid profile differences between paired cancerous and non-cancerous lung tissue samples from 86 patients with suspected stage I or IIA primary NSCLC. Correlation and co-occurrence analysis revealed significant lipid profile differences between cancer and non-cancer samples. Further analysis of machine-learned lipid categories for the differentially abundant molecular formulas identified a high abundance sterol, high abundance and high m/z sphingolipid, and low abundance glycerophospholipid metabolic phenotype across the NSCLC samples. At the class level, higher abundances of sterol esters and lower abundances of cardiolipins were observed suggesting altered stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) or acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1) activity and altered human cardiolipin synthase 1 or lysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity respectively, the latter of which is known to confer apoptotic resistance. The presence of a shared metabolic phenotype across a variety of genetically distinct NSCLC subtypes suggests that this phenotype is necessary for NSCLC development and may result from multiple distinct genetic lesions. Thus, targeting the shared affected pathways may be beneficial for a variety of genetically distinct NSCLC subtypes.",

The main objective of this study was to characterize structural and morphologic changes arising from the addition of phosphorene to polymeric membranes. Here, phosphorene was physically incorporated into a blend of polysulfone (PSf) and sulfonated poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) doping solution. Protein and dye rejection studies were carried out to determine the permeability and selectivity of the membranes. Since loss of material additives during filtration processes is a challenge, the stability of phosphorene nanoparticles in different environments was also examined.

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, has accelerated the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) masks as one of the methods to reduce and/or eliminate transmission of the coronavirus across communities. Despite the availability of different coronavirus vaccines, it is still recommended by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and local authorities to apply public safety measures including maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks. This includes individuals who have been fully vaccinated. Remarkable increase in scientific studies, along with manufacturing-related research and development investigations, have been performed in an attempt to provide better PPE solutions during the pandemic. Recent literature has estimated the filtration efficiency (FE) of face masks and respirators shedding the light on specific targeted parameters that investigators can measure, detect, evaluate, and provide reliable data with consistent results. This review showed the variability in testing protocols and FE evaluation methods of different face mask materials and/or brands. In addition to the safety requirements needed to perform aerosol viral filtration tests, one of the main challenges researchers currently face is the inability to simulate or mimic true aerosol filtration scenarios via laboratory experiments, field tests, and in vitro/in vivo investigations. Moreover, the FE through the mask can be influenced by different filtration mechanisms, environmental parameters, filtration material properties, number of layers used, packing density, fiber charge density, fiber diameter, aerosol type and particle size, aerosol face velocity and concentration loadings, and infectious concentrations generated due to different human activities. These parameters are not fully understood and constrain the design, production, efficacy, and efficiency of face masks.",

    "abstract": "CD8 T cells and NK cells are the two major cytotoxic lymphocytes that carry out cell-mediated immunity and regulate other immune responses. However, we do not completely understand human CD8 T cell and NK cell metabolic requirements and they have not been compared in the same experiments. We activated human CD8 T cells by two anti-CD3/CD28 mAb methods, and we stimulated both CD8 T cells and NK cells with IL-12/IL-18. When glucose (Glc) could not be used, human CD8 T cells either died or became hypofunctional, depending upon the anti-CD3/CD28 activation method. In contrast, Glc starvation did not decrease the percentage of IL-12/IL-18-stimulated human NK cells that made IFN-\u03b3. NK cells were relatively fuel resilient and used Glc, glutamine (Gln), fatty acid, or acetate to power IFN-\u03b3 expression. Surprisingly, strongly activated human CD8 T cells required Gln for glycolysis and Glc uptake. We showed that human CD8 T cells regulate Glc uptake by a novel mechanism related to the TXNIP pleiotropic protein. These conditions may be relevant to septic patients who have high blood Glc but low Gln. Under the conditions tested, Gln did not change human NK cell TXNIP expression. Our experiments reveal fundamental differences in human CD8 T cell and NK cell metabolism and the fuels needed for IFN-\u03b3 production.",
