    "abstract": "Metabolic flux analysis requires both a reliable metabolic model and reliable metabolic profiles in characterizing metabolic reprogramming. Advances in analytic methodologies enable production of high-quality metabolomics datasets capturing isotopic flux. However, useful metabolic models can be difficult to derive due to the lack of relatively complete atom-resolved metabolic networks for a variety of organisms, including human. Here, we developed a neighborhood-specific graph coloring method that creates unique identifiers for each atom in a compound facilitating construction of an atom-resolved metabolic network. What is more, this method is guaranteed to generate the same identifier for symmetric atoms, enabling automatic identification of possible additional mappings caused by molecular symmetry. Furthermore, a compound coloring identifier derived from the corresponding atom coloring identifiers can be used for compound harmonization across various metabolic network databases, which is an essential first step in network integration. With the compound coloring identifiers, 8865 correspondences between KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and MetaCyc compounds are detected, with 5451 of them confirmed by other identifiers provided by the two databases. In addition, we found that the Enzyme Commission numbers (EC) of reactions can be used to validate possible correspondence pairs, with 1848 unconfirmed pairs validated by commonality in reaction ECs. Moreover, we were able to detect various issues and errors with compound representation in KEGG and MetaCyc databases by compound coloring identifiers, demonstrating the usefulness of this methodology for database curation.",

    "abstract": "The Metabolomics Workbench (MW) is a public scientific data repository consisting of experimental data and metadata from metabolomics studies collected with mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. MW has been constantly evolving; updating its 'mwTab' text file format, adding a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format, implementing a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface, and nearly quadrupling the number of datasets hosted on the repository within the last three years. In order to keep up with the quickly evolving state of the MW repository, the 'mwtab' Python library and package have been continuously updated to mirror the changes in the 'mwTab' and JSONized formats and contain many new enhancements including methods for interacting with the MW REST interface, enhanced format validation features, and advanced features for parsing and searching for specific metabolite data and metadata. We used the enhanced format validation features to evaluate all available datasets in MW to facilitate improved curation and FAIRness of the repository. The 'mwtab' Python package is now officially released as version 1.0.1 and is freely available on GitHub and the Python Package Index (PyPI) under a Clear Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license with documentation available on ReadTheDocs.",
