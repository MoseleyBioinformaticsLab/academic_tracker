      "abstract": "Phospholipases D (PLDs) catalyze hydrolysis of the diester bond of phospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid and the free lipid headgroup. In mammals, PLD enzymes comprise the intracellular enzymes PLD1 and PLD2 and possibly the proteins encoded by related genes, as well as a class of cell surface and secreted enzymes with structural homology to ectonucleotide phosphatases/phosphodiesterases as typified by autotaxin (ENPP2) that have lysoPLD activities. Genetic and pharmacological loss-of-function approaches implicate these enzymes in intra- and intercellular signaling mediated by the lipid products phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, and their metabolites, while the possibility that the water-soluble product of their reactions is biologically relevant has received far less attention. PLD1 and PLD2 are highly selective for phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas autotaxin has broader substrate \u2026",

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS) are a recently recognized class of \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 that may contribute to disease risk. The aim of this study was to conduct a pilot investigation of a subset of available biospecimens from obese children with a focus on PFAS with respect to established measures of cardiometabolic disease risks. METHODS: Obese children were enrolled in two separate studies at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital (an urban population in Columbus, Ohio) and at Kentucky Children\u2019s Hospital (a rural population in Lexington, KY). Measurement of several markers of cardiometabolic disease risks were determined. Archived blood serum samples from these two groups (25 from each site) were processed for measurement of PFAS.

      "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Triple negative breast cancer TNBC carries a poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, given its higher genomic instability, tendency toward early metastasis, and lack of effective targeted therapies. As obesity is a risk factor for TNBC, understanding the mechanistic linkage between TNBC and obesity is crucial for the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies. TNBC activates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMT program mediated by EMT transcription factors, including Twist. Twist is highly expressed in TNBC cells, and its expression is positively correlated with metastatic potential. Our preliminary data showed that Twist interacted with BRD4 to regulate its target gene transcription, and Autotaxin ATX and LPAR1 were dramatically increased in Twist-overexpressing breast cancer cells and adipocytes. Encoded by the ENPP2 gene, ATX is a secreted enzyme that produces most of the extracellular lysophosphatidic acid LPA, which signals through its receptors LPAR1-6 to mediate a wide range of inflammatory processes including wound healing, fibrosis and metastasis. Interestingly, both Twist and ATX were demonstrated to be involved in diet-induced obesity.Descriptors:Subject Categories:Distribution Statement:APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE",

      "abstract": "Lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) are bioactive radyl hydrocarbon-substituted derivatives of glycerol 3-phosphate. LPA metabolism and signaling are implicated in heritable risk of coronary artery disease. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of these processes attenuate experimental atherosclerosis. LPA accumulates in atheromas, which may be a consequence of association with low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The source, regulation, and biological activity of LDL-associated LPA are unknown. We examined effects of experimental hyperlipidemia on levels and distribution of circulating LPA in mice. The majority of plasma LPA was associated with albumin in plasma from wild-type mice fed normal chow. LDL-associated LPA was increased in plasma from high-fat western diet fed mice that are genetically prone to hyperlipidemia (LDL receptor knockout or activated PCSK9 overexpressing C57Bl6). Adipose-specific deficiency of the ENPP2 gene encoding the LPA-generating secreted lysophospholipase D autotaxin (ATX) attenuated these western diet-dependent increases in LPA. ATX-dependent increases in LDL-associated LPA were observed in isolated incubated plasma. ATX acted directly on LDL-associated lysophospholipid substrates in vitro. LDL from all human subjects examined contained LPA and was decreased by lipid lowering drug therapies. Human and mouse plasma therefore contains a diet-sensitive LDL-associated LPA pool that might contribute to the cardiovascular disease promoting effects of LPA.",

The main precursor for LPA, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is derived majorly from the highly abundant phosphatidylcholine (PC). Hydrolysis of LPC to the circulating LPA is catalyzed by the enzyme autotaxin (ATX), a secreted lysophospholipase D. We investigated the effects of altering dietary intake of PC and pharmacological inhibition of ATX on breast cancer development in mice. To formulate diets with defined PC levels we used tandem mass spectrometry to measure the concentration of PC in various components of fat used to manufacture rodent diets. We determined that casein is the main source of PC when present in rodent diets. High fat diets (60% kcal fat) were formulated with casein (high PC) or amino \u2026",
